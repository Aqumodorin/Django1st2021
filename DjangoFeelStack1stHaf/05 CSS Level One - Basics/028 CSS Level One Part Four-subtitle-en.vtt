Hello everyone and welcome to part four of CSSA level 1 we will actually be doing any coding for this

00:11.550 --> 00:12.200
lecture.

00:12.210 --> 00:17.580
Instead we'll just be getting a tour of the Google Chrome browser Inspektor which is a really useful

00:17.580 --> 00:23.180
tool for us to actually explore the TMLC assess and even later on javascript on a Web site.

00:23.550 --> 00:28.770
So go ahead and open up Google Chrome and let's start exploring.

00:28.770 --> 00:35.370
OK so here I am at Google Chrome and I have the part three that HVM mail file from last time which is

00:35.370 --> 00:42.760
linked to the part 3 C Ss open up in my browser and then in another tab I have the Google home Web site.

00:42.930 --> 00:49.290
What I want you to do is with the three Rached female file open you can right click and previously you

00:49.290 --> 00:54.830
seen how we can view page source and that shows just the HCM mail that's linked to this document.

00:54.930 --> 00:59.940
But what I want to do now is instead of just viewing the page source which is just the HTL I can right

00:59.940 --> 01:03.030
click on this and click on inspect.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.820
And now let me zoom in a little bit.

01:05.820 --> 01:07.460
I can see that here on this panel.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.850
I have the HTL code.

01:08.850 --> 01:14.110
So that's what we've seen before and stuff gets highlighted as I select that psoas I select H-3.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.830
I can see that H-3 over here is highlighted.

01:16.830 --> 01:20.940
And you can also see that there is almost like a bit of a border around that some parts blue some parts

01:20.940 --> 01:21.310
orange.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.450
We're going to be discussing that later on.

01:23.700 --> 01:28.500
But what I really want to focus on here is the styles since we're talking about C Ss so we can bring

01:28.500 --> 01:34.530
this tab over and here I can actually see the styles that I was assigning to that CSSA So second div

01:34.980 --> 01:36.810
is a class where the color is red.

01:36.810 --> 01:41.890
Now what's really cool about this is you can actually click on some of these things and edit them.

01:41.970 --> 01:46.860
So if you begin to zoom out so we can see the whole thing click on color red and you can actually change

01:46.860 --> 01:48.640
this color in real time.

01:48.690 --> 01:51.920
So if you want it to be blue you can see right here on the second div..

01:52.050 --> 01:54.170
It's actually changing.

01:54.390 --> 01:56.380
So we can make it something extreme.

01:56.450 --> 02:03.940
Can just make it any color of the rainbow we want great and other things we can do is select an element

02:03.970 --> 02:05.040
inspect it.

02:05.470 --> 02:09.420
So for instance here on NPR we can see now that it's an ally a.

02:09.490 --> 02:11.020
And we could see that border in color.

02:11.050 --> 02:15.100
So again we can change the color or we can even change other properties in real time.

02:15.100 --> 02:21.850
So photo make this order super thick you can see that I'm changing it in real time as I type this or

02:21.860 --> 02:25.610
how I want to make it dotted and sort of solid.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.290
I could do that as well.

02:28.370 --> 02:28.980
All right.

02:29.090 --> 02:32.120
So there's two reasons why I want to show you this.

02:32.180 --> 02:38.750
One reason is that if you're working on a Web site you can immediately just load it up start inspecting

02:38.750 --> 02:44.330
it and quickly change things on the fly so you can see how things look and change them immediately without

02:44.330 --> 02:47.060
having to constantly refresh your Web site.

02:47.060 --> 02:51.650
You can just play out the colors here live instead of constantly refreshing.

02:51.650 --> 02:56.700
But the more useful tool on this is actually exploring other Web sites.

02:56.720 --> 03:02.330
So for example you come here to this Google home page and if you're interested in how something works

03:02.330 --> 03:10.200
or what is going on maybe you right click inspect and you can click on this little tool which is select

03:10.200 --> 03:12.180
an element in the page to inspect that.

03:12.190 --> 03:13.810
So click here on the Google search button.

03:13.840 --> 03:19.120
And now we can see the various styles that have to do with it so you can see it has a color we can change

03:19.120 --> 03:20.490
that color if we want.

03:20.530 --> 03:25.120
So we see here we're changing the font of the actual Google search that we changed as something green

03:25.120 --> 03:26.350
or blue etcetera.

03:26.440 --> 03:30.300
Something to note here is the only thing I'm changing is what I'm seeing in my browser.

03:30.430 --> 03:35.320
If I refresh this page I'm not actually changing any of the files or any of the SS files.

03:35.440 --> 03:40.000
But again you can play around with this maybe make the font huge.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.570
So Google search et cetera.

03:41.860 --> 03:47.170
And as we approach javascript and learn how to work with the DOM which we haven't talked about yet but

03:47.180 --> 03:53.470
we will in the future will see how we can actually use javascript to grab some of these elements and

03:53.470 --> 03:54.720
then affect them.

03:54.990 --> 03:59.830
But right now I just want you to be aware of the Chrome browser and Specter as a really great tool for

03:59.830 --> 04:03.970
you not just to explore your own web sites but other peoples web sites as well.

04:04.170 --> 04:04.590
OK.

04:04.630 --> 04:05.980
That's really it for this lecture.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.810
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

04:07.810 --> 04:10.330
We'll hop back in the C S and start coding again.

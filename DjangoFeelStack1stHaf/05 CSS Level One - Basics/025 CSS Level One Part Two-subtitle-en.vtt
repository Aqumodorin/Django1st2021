Hello everyone and welcome to part two of CSSA level 1 in part two we're going to begin to discuss backgrounds

00:12.200 --> 00:13.390
and borders.

00:13.460 --> 00:18.670
We will also show you how to utilize the div and span tags that we mentioned during the H.M.S. of the

00:18.680 --> 00:21.490
course but were actually able to really use.

00:21.710 --> 00:24.710
Let's get started by jumping to the editor and RC S S files.

00:25.700 --> 00:28.470
All right so here I have my browser open as well as my editor.

00:28.550 --> 00:34.970
I have in the mail file have called it part 2 that HVM L and I use this link with the stylesheet to

00:34.970 --> 00:40.250
reference in other CSSA file called Part 2 underscore master that see SS and you can really name these

00:40.250 --> 00:40.880
whatever you want.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.050
Just make sure that your link is correct.

00:43.160 --> 00:47.220
To get started let's create a little bit of content in this age team l file.

00:47.270 --> 00:50.810
I'm going to say this is a paragraph

00:53.510 --> 00:59.570
and we'll also mention it's outside any device so outside any div container.

00:59.810 --> 01:05.150
And then I'm actually going to create it live in a div allows us to essentially create a container.

01:05.150 --> 01:10.010
And you'll notice that as I autocomplete this I get this class pop up don't worry about that for now

01:10.010 --> 01:13.250
we're going to learn about class and a future lecturer and C Ss route.

01:13.280 --> 01:18.820
Just leave it as the basic div opening and closing tags and I'm going to make three paragraph tags inside

01:18.830 --> 01:19.590
of this.

01:19.610 --> 01:24.370
First of all say I'm inside the div.

01:24.410 --> 01:34.540
Second one will say I'm also inside the div and then the third one is going to say this inside div and

01:34.540 --> 01:44.910
then we'll use the span tag that we've learned about and we'll say inside spam and save that let's refresh

01:44.910 --> 01:49.670
make sure everything's working and we see here the subparagraph outside any div I'm inside.

01:49.740 --> 01:53.200
Inside the div inside div and then inside span in all caps.

01:53.220 --> 01:53.930
Perfect.

01:53.940 --> 01:55.130
So now we have all the content.

01:55.140 --> 01:58.590
It's time to play for CSSA file to see how we can affect that content.

01:58.800 --> 02:03.490
And I'm a little zoomed in here so yours probably won't be as large in your browser as mine is but this

02:03.540 --> 02:05.360
just so you can view it.

02:05.400 --> 02:10.400
First thing I want to discuss is affecting the entire body of the H Tim L.

02:10.620 --> 02:14.960
So you'll notice all or each Steimle content is inside these two body tags.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.930
Everything else is just meta data.

02:17.010 --> 02:22.560
So all the actually C.M. content is within these two body ties which means if I want to affect everything

02:23.090 --> 02:26.170
essentially and that is T.M. I can call the body tag.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.710
So that's my select attack.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.700
And then I can't affect the property.

02:29.700 --> 02:33.070
For instance one property I can affect is the background.

02:33.420 --> 02:37.980
And you'll notice that Adam text editor will try to help you out with a bunch of prompts here.

02:37.980 --> 02:40.560
Background color background position repeat etc..

02:40.770 --> 02:46.740
Let's keep it basic and just do the background color and I will just type in a color here.

02:46.740 --> 02:52.230
Let's type in gray as our background color going to save this and refreshes page.

02:52.230 --> 02:56.280
And now I noticed that the entire background for everything in the body which is essentially all the

02:56.290 --> 02:58.490
HTL content is great.

02:58.530 --> 02:59.600
Perfect.

02:59.610 --> 03:07.670
Now let's explore the div and remember the div allows us to essentially make these containers so div

03:07.990 --> 03:14.720
or specify the background color for the DO to be something like Blue semi-colon.

03:14.760 --> 03:21.440
Save it and refresh here and now everything that was inside the do these three lines including that

03:21.440 --> 03:28.860
inside span are now have a background of blue and some also here for colors for very basic colors.

03:28.860 --> 03:35.020
It doesn't matter whether you say background color or if you just say background either one of these

03:35.020 --> 03:35.420
will work.

03:35.410 --> 03:37.660
So if I save this and change this.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.970
So let's say something like red which is going to be really bright and annoying.

03:40.980 --> 03:43.650
So I want to suggest you do that but there it is.

03:43.650 --> 03:44.400
I'm inside.

03:44.450 --> 03:49.620
Nelson I have etc background essentially works the same way as background color when it comes to just

03:49.650 --> 03:51.060
a very basic coloring.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.700
Now let's explore how to do borders.

03:54.750 --> 03:57.760
So borders are going to require three elements to it.

03:57.780 --> 04:03.080
Basically the border color the border with and then the border style.

04:03.090 --> 04:11.920
So for instance if I make a border for the div and I say the border let's say the border color is going

04:11.920 --> 04:14.410
to be blue.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.150
So the border colors blue if I click refresh here I'm not going to see anything.

04:18.270 --> 04:23.100
And that's because I haven't defined the border with and the border style so I needed to find those

04:23.100 --> 04:23.810
two first.

04:23.840 --> 04:31.810
Otherwise CSSA doesn't really know how thick of a border I want be around this div so will say border

04:32.860 --> 04:38.320
width and notice that we can actually specify left right top image bottom etc. are going to keep things

04:38.320 --> 04:40.810
basic for now and just specify the border with.

04:40.920 --> 04:45.790
And if I hit enter and text editor always here to help also says you want a thin border a median border

04:45.790 --> 04:46.920
or a thick border.

04:47.110 --> 04:48.520
So I'll say thick for now.

04:49.560 --> 04:57.720
And then we'll also say border style and the border style will do is something like a well should say

04:57.750 --> 04:59.050
dotted.

04:59.160 --> 05:06.490
So let's save this refresh and you can see I have a dotted blue border around the div.

05:06.600 --> 05:10.280
Now you may be also wondering well what's the difference between thick and thin.

05:10.410 --> 05:18.370
So if I replace this with thin save that and refresh then I see if you can really see here but if you

05:18.370 --> 05:23.380
do this on your computer you see extremely thin pixels here of the border.

05:23.380 --> 05:29.470
Usually however you don't want to thin or thick you want to specify your own thickness and you can do

05:29.470 --> 05:38.410
that by specifying the pixels so I can say something like 10 dx and that will tell me that I want the

05:38.410 --> 05:39.840
border with to be 10 pixels.

05:39.850 --> 05:47.380
If I refresh this then I can see 10 pixels here and later on will also see how to specify pixel widths

05:47.470 --> 05:50.680
in relevance or in relationship to other elements.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.250
So you don't have to have an absolute pixel.

05:53.350 --> 05:57.660
So now let's make this super thick so make this 100 refresh this.

05:57.730 --> 05:59.750
And I can see I have a really super thick.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.900
So only four were able to show up.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.500
Let's make this much thinner.

06:03.550 --> 06:04.880
Something like five.

06:05.020 --> 06:13.040
Save this refresh and here we have it five pixels can two pixels saving refresh and you get the idea.

06:13.070 --> 06:13.580
All right.

06:13.720 --> 06:19.180
So that was background background color and then the three elements you need for border the style the

06:19.180 --> 06:20.280
width and the color.

06:20.390 --> 06:24.730
And it's a lot of fun to play around with the styles especially since the Adam text editor is really

06:24.730 --> 06:26.840
going to help you choose styles.

06:26.890 --> 06:31.490
You can also do things such as a double refresh.

06:31.760 --> 06:36.380
You can see this kind of double border almost looks like a painting.

06:36.700 --> 06:37.250
OK.

06:37.740 --> 06:40.640
So that was how we can affect things inside the div.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.050
Now let's show you how we can affect text color.

06:43.050 --> 06:49.320
So if I say something like paragraph called Color and make everything in sight of this something like

06:49.830 --> 06:55.290
green then that will affect all the paragraphs regardless of where they are.

06:55.290 --> 07:02.780
When you make this into a clear color let's say something like yellow and let's make this background's

07:04.110 --> 07:08.490
blue and make this border color orange.

07:08.510 --> 07:10.720
That way things are hopefully more clear for you to see.

07:11.580 --> 07:12.120
All right.

07:12.310 --> 07:18.610
So what I've done here is I changed the colors of the div background and border but I also said all

07:18.610 --> 07:23.680
paragraph elements have the color yellow and notice I want to say all paragraph elements.

07:23.680 --> 07:27.060
It doesn't matter whether they're inside the div or outside.

07:27.100 --> 07:32.290
When I call something like this it specifically requests all paragraph elements regardless of where

07:32.290 --> 07:33.450
they are.

07:33.550 --> 07:40.000
Later I will show you how to select elements that are inside of divs and also a specific element type

07:40.010 --> 07:46.000
so maybe only want to effect headings inside of a div or heading force inside of a specific div.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.850
Then lastly I want to show you the span tag and the span allows us to grab anything within that span.

07:52.850 --> 07:55.920
So remember it was these two words inside span.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.430
So I will call background here

08:02.510 --> 08:10.710
and say something like read and let's give it a color of black.

08:10.760 --> 08:18.230
So now I save this and refresh over here I can see inside span is now background red color black.

08:18.290 --> 08:18.550
All right.

08:18.560 --> 08:19.280
So what do we learn.

08:19.280 --> 08:23.840
So far we've learned the body div and Spanta x.

08:23.870 --> 08:28.940
Hopefully now you realize you can basically call any female tag and start affecting its properties.

08:28.940 --> 08:34.250
The properties we learned about so far are the background order and color properties.

08:34.250 --> 08:40.250
Lastly I want to show you another case of background where you can actually set the background to be

08:40.250 --> 08:41.970
an image.

08:41.990 --> 08:44.390
So let me grab an image.

08:44.450 --> 08:48.980
You can do this just by going to google images and then looking up whatever image you want.

08:48.980 --> 08:54.660
So let's say I want a picture of a beach I can look up this right click here on this image.

08:54.740 --> 08:58.420
Then I click view image and it takes me to this link right here.

08:58.460 --> 09:07.250
So let me copy that full path and for background I'm going say not grey but I will actually call a special

09:07.310 --> 09:11.420
key word your L in passen that it's higher your l.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.060
So that's linking the background to this image.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.560
So now I will save this Ambac undersea esus basics.

09:17.570 --> 09:24.800
I will refresh and we can see here we get the if I expand this we get the whole beach image as the background

09:24.800 --> 09:30.100
for the body if we want it we don't need to have it zoomed in like this.

09:30.100 --> 09:38.920
We can specify various properties of this background image things for instance such as backgrounds repeats

09:38.950 --> 09:44.390
or background no rips etc. so we can actually specify how many times we want it to repeat.

09:44.440 --> 09:49.690
In our case the background image is so large that it's not going to make much of a difference because

09:49.690 --> 09:50.280
I'm zoomed in.

09:50.290 --> 09:56.920
But if I zoom out here you can begin to see that I have this background image I'm zoomed out right now

09:57.190 --> 09:58.720
and I see that entire beach.

09:58.930 --> 10:07.900
So if I want the background to repeat multiple times then under AP background Rippy I can say repeat

10:09.110 --> 10:13.440
save that refresh this page and I can see now the background is being repeated.

10:13.550 --> 10:13.820
All right.

10:13.820 --> 10:17.300
So so far we have these kind of funky really 90s looking.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.560
Tim L. sites.

10:18.620 --> 10:21.320
Later on we're going to see how he can make these into much nicer.

10:21.360 --> 10:25.520
Right now the point is to understand how CSSA works OK.

10:25.580 --> 10:28.210
Do you have any questions feel free to post them to the Kewney forums.

10:28.460 --> 10:29.750
I'll see you at the next lecture.

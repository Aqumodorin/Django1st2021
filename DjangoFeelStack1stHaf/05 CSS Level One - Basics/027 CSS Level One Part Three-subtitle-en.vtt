00:04.960 --> 00:11.390
Hello everyone and welcome to part three of CSSA level 1 a major part of what we've seen so far has

00:11.390 --> 00:17.510
revolved around the idea of CSA selectors where selectors in general are used to target HVM elements

00:17.510 --> 00:23.760
that we want the style so far we've only approached the idea of selecting HTL elements by their tags

00:23.770 --> 00:27.800
so grab all paragraph tags or grab all lists tags.

00:27.880 --> 00:31.800
But what if we only want to select subsets or select the single elements.

00:31.800 --> 00:38.110
That is where we can use selectors to clarify exactly what elements we want in each team T.M. we can

00:38.110 --> 00:43.900
use IDs to target single elements and we can use classes to target groups of elements and then we can

00:43.900 --> 00:49.020
also use a wide variety of combinations of selector tags to target certain combinations of elements

00:49.030 --> 00:53.620
things such as descendents or adjacent siblings and we're going to talk a lot more about that.

00:53.820 --> 00:56.800
So let's jump right in to show how this all works.

00:56.800 --> 00:57.870
All right so here we have it.

00:57.880 --> 01:04.060
HVM male called Part 3 him and it's linked to Part 3 underscore mastery that CSSA and in the body of

01:04.060 --> 01:11.620
this aist hymnal I'm going to add some content I'll add a heading theory that says Aima H-3 heading

01:12.850 --> 01:16.010
and then I'm going to add some divs.

01:16.300 --> 01:22.610
And now when it says class member auto completes class I will actually add some classes to this so I'll

01:22.630 --> 01:31.590
call this first div class and we'll put a paragraph in here it says I'm inside the first class.

01:31.860 --> 01:36.720
That way we can see what's going on when we actually begin to Selby's that I will add another division

01:36.740 --> 01:41.630
container I will call this second div and in a paragraph.

01:41.630 --> 01:42.460
All right.

01:42.680 --> 01:46.220
Inside the second div class

01:49.780 --> 01:57.260
and then we'll add a little bit more I'm going to add a paragraph and with this paragraph we're going

01:57.260 --> 01:58.840
to add an ID to it.

01:59.740 --> 02:04.650
So out of the are we're going to set it equal to singled

02:07.260 --> 02:13.030
And in this paragraph will say these must be unique.

02:15.350 --> 02:22.470
Then we're going to make another heading three that says here's a list and you can also just copy and

02:22.470 --> 02:24.740
paste this from the part 3 or 8.

02:24.810 --> 02:28.820
If you don't want to type it all out yourself will have an unordered list.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.490
I'll say something like.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.890
Confirm you can write whatever text you want in here.

02:35.480 --> 02:39.990
And then I will say something like feedback.

02:40.050 --> 02:45.150
Question mark and inside of these list elements we're also going to add inputs.

02:45.210 --> 02:50.010
So the first input is going to just be a checkbox and put.

02:50.100 --> 02:57.580
And the second input is going to be a text so checkbox really similar to a radio button that we've seen

02:57.580 --> 03:02.960
earlier except in our case it's actually just a check box that you've probably seen before.

03:04.250 --> 03:04.840
Online.

03:04.850 --> 03:11.180
And then another list we're going to drop an anchor tag here and we'll give an address to our Web site

03:12.310 --> 03:19.960
this website will be my web site Parian data dot com and we'll say higher data.

03:19.980 --> 03:25.310
I know there's a lot of content so feel free to pause or just copy and paste from the notes and then

03:25.310 --> 03:32.300
we'll put another anchor tag here that has an RF of some other Web site which is say npr.org or you

03:32.300 --> 03:35.790
can put any news Web site you want here or really any web site.

03:35.810 --> 03:38.220
Also it's NPR.

03:38.280 --> 03:38.700
All right.

03:38.700 --> 03:39.650
Lots of stuff here.

03:39.660 --> 03:43.560
So let's break it down real quick let's refresh this to make sure things are linked.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.850
Expand that a bit.

03:45.270 --> 03:45.540
All right.

03:45.540 --> 03:50.410
So right now I have this H-3 heading something that's inside the first day of class something that's

03:50.450 --> 03:52.260
that side the second class.

03:52.310 --> 03:54.770
They make sure I spelled that correctly.

03:54.960 --> 03:59.510
Refresh this and then IDs must be unique or ID.

03:59.520 --> 04:05.850
We have here is a list conferred with a checkbox on it that we can click on and off feedback with some

04:05.850 --> 04:07.370
text input here.

04:07.530 --> 04:10.610
Then two links here Paria data and NPR.

04:10.650 --> 04:11.200
All right.

04:11.670 --> 04:12.650
We have all of this.

04:12.660 --> 04:17.160
So now let's jump to CSX and actually talk about how we can link to this.

04:17.150 --> 04:19.740
So notice here they have classes.

04:19.740 --> 04:22.150
And then my idees.

04:22.260 --> 04:31.370
So if I come to my C Ss and I say something like DIVX and I specify the color of all divs to be read

04:32.540 --> 04:38.210
and then I come back here and I refresh this no matter where the div is no matter what class it is as

04:38.210 --> 04:41.090
long as it has the tag it is going to be the color red.

04:41.090 --> 04:42.820
So first div becomes red.

04:42.830 --> 04:45.170
Second div becomes red.

04:45.170 --> 04:49.440
Normally however you don't want to affect every single tag that has.

04:49.430 --> 04:51.900
Did you want to select subsets.

04:51.980 --> 04:58.580
In that case we can use these classes that we assigned so I can select first or second div instead of

04:58.580 --> 05:00.480
selecting everything that's inside.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.560
And he did.

05:01.750 --> 05:04.030
And that's the key to using classes.

05:04.040 --> 05:11.980
Now what you can't do if a class is just say first div and then color something blue.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.880
Otherwise if I refresh this.

05:14.060 --> 05:17.390
Notice no change occurs when you're dealing with a class.

05:17.460 --> 05:21.780
You tell CSSA that it's a class through a dot.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.490
So classes always start with a dot or a period.

05:24.510 --> 05:31.020
So now if I save this refresh over here I can see that I'm inside the first class has now become blue.

05:31.470 --> 05:38.670
And likewise I can grab the second do and color that red.

05:38.860 --> 05:39.730
Refresh this.

05:39.730 --> 05:44.760
And I can see now inside the first class inside second class are there own individual color.

05:44.760 --> 05:49.240
So this is a very common tool to use and this is where we're getting in today of selectors.

05:49.240 --> 05:53.720
So for classes the always start of this for this period.

05:53.860 --> 05:54.310
OK.

05:54.490 --> 06:00.120
Now we noticed that we also had an I.D. and for IDS one I.D. to be unique.

06:00.130 --> 06:06.500
It just is attached to a single element versus classes can be attached to multiple elements so for an

06:06.570 --> 06:08.470
I.D. It's usually just a single element.

06:08.470 --> 06:13.190
Classes can be across multiple divisions multiple centers multiple paragraphs etc..

06:14.650 --> 06:18.870
Classes use a hash tag so shift number three.

06:18.870 --> 06:20.100
There's a hashtag Lehre.

06:20.300 --> 06:24.190
And then we put in the name of the class which in our case was singled out.

06:24.350 --> 06:27.900
Now we can see that also the syntax highlighting tells you oh you're doing a class here.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.890
Let me double check that it's singled out.

06:29.930 --> 06:30.510
There it is.

06:30.560 --> 06:37.070
Unless change is something to Kolar let's say green

06:39.780 --> 06:45.410
Now let's also give it an it's something called a text decoration text decoration.

06:45.410 --> 06:47.230
I'm just going to kind of throw this in.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.830
These are things such as over lines under lines or like a strike through a line through.

06:51.890 --> 06:54.250
So we'll give that a line through.

06:54.240 --> 06:54.960
Save it.

06:54.980 --> 06:58.710
Let's refresh or can see here we see IDs must be unique.

06:58.740 --> 06:59.730
Is now the color green.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.380
And also has a line through.

07:01.520 --> 07:06.110
So there we're kind of just throwing in a little tune on both how to use IDS and the fact that you can

07:06.110 --> 07:11.870
use text declarations as another property and you can always use the CSSA references and the notes for

07:11.960 --> 07:13.860
various properties if you're looking for them.

07:14.940 --> 07:22.080
And other common thing actually not common sorry is the Asterix the Asterix is a selector for selecting

07:22.230 --> 07:24.990
every element on the page.

07:25.000 --> 07:34.150
So if I say color elements and then say black I save this and refresh is going to color everything black

07:34.360 --> 07:36.320
and it's going to overwrite certain things.

07:36.460 --> 07:43.270
It won't override IDs but you can see here that it's overwriting these class calls this asterisks call

07:43.900 --> 07:47.830
tries to overwrite as much as it can over all the elements.

07:47.850 --> 07:48.510
A quick note though.

07:48.520 --> 07:53.590
This is actually very uncommon usually don't want to just call everything like this.

07:53.680 --> 07:58.750
Maybe if you want something like a background but it's usually pretty uncommon to just call an asterix

07:58.750 --> 07:59.000
there.

07:59.020 --> 08:03.240
Although I do want you to be aware or you can use an asterix to select all the elements in the page

08:03.280 --> 08:04.200
HTML.

08:04.360 --> 08:08.390
However it will be overwritten if they have a particular ID.

08:08.400 --> 08:08.820
All right.

08:08.820 --> 08:11.820
Finally I want to discuss a few different types of selectors.

08:11.850 --> 08:17.680
You can check out the links in the actual CSSA file if you're interested in more of these.

08:17.700 --> 08:24.180
And I have the link open here in a nother tab but basically here is a CSA selector reference and you

08:24.180 --> 08:28.430
can actually call elements on many many types of selectors.

08:28.430 --> 08:33.990
So there's a huge list here of the various types of selectors and I want to show you a few examples

08:33.990 --> 08:35.110
of the more common ones.

08:35.120 --> 08:41.430
So far we've seen things like class like Dot class hash tag ID Asterix to select all the elements and

08:41.430 --> 08:44.400
then certain elements like just calling the element tag.

08:44.430 --> 08:44.820
All right.

08:44.820 --> 08:49.950
Let's show an example of one of those CSSA selectors known as adjacent siblings and that has to do with

08:49.980 --> 08:52.200
elements that are next to each other.

08:52.200 --> 08:58.830
Let's imagine that I wanted to select all unordered list items that are next to an H-3 heading 3.

08:59.130 --> 09:06.780
I would do this I'd say heading 3 and then I use the plus operator unordered lists curly braces and

09:06.780 --> 09:08.190
then whatever property I wanted.

09:08.190 --> 09:17.370
So let's give them a border and we can do border border style and border thickness all in one line.

09:17.370 --> 09:25.650
So instead of saying like we've done before border color and then order with and then border style I

09:25.650 --> 09:28.080
can actually just call border by itself.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.640
Pasan a thickness.

09:29.670 --> 09:36.870
So let's give it four pixels then give it a style let's say it's the dotted style and then give it a

09:37.380 --> 09:42.750
color let's give it purple and that's kind of a quicker nicer way to create borders.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.830
So I'll save this refresher page here.

09:46.020 --> 09:52.590
And now I can see that any unordered list that is next to an H3 now has this border.

09:52.810 --> 09:58.120
So that's known as adjacent siblings and you can always reference here on the links in this SS file

09:58.240 --> 10:02.140
for the notes the various different types of CSSA selectors.

10:02.140 --> 10:08.980
So in our case this plus basically says Select all unordered list elements that are placed immediately

10:08.980 --> 10:10.690
after an H-3.

10:10.720 --> 10:16.180
OK there are two more CSSA selectors that I want to cover for this lecture and one of them is known

10:16.180 --> 10:17.030
as descendants.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.180
And the other one is for attributes.

10:19.420 --> 10:22.370
So for the students It basically looks like this.

10:22.720 --> 10:28.990
If we want to grab all anchor tags that are inside a list you just put a space between them so all the

10:29.080 --> 10:32.500
tags inside of a list and then we can affect them.

10:32.500 --> 10:37.360
So let's give them a color let's say something like red.

10:37.740 --> 10:43.950
So my colon there refresh our page and we can see now that any anchor tag that's inside a list now has

10:43.950 --> 10:45.250
the color red.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.600
And then the last one I want to show you is how to actually effect attributes.

10:50.660 --> 10:58.520
So let's say you want to go further than this and actually grab any anchor Ted inside of a list with

10:58.610 --> 11:06.750
a particular ref and actual link that it can use square brackets for this and say Atra here equal to

11:07.850 --> 11:09.500
the libido E.W..

11:09.650 --> 11:16.520
Now let's go with the last one which was npr.org or whatever website you happen to put in there.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.020
We'll give it a color.

11:18.340 --> 11:25.390
Let's just give it the color something like blue and let's give it a Borders.

11:25.390 --> 11:27.320
Let's practice using that border again.

11:27.370 --> 11:31.540
Remember you just give it a thicknesse such as five pixels.

11:31.660 --> 11:35.710
The style looks give it the style solid and then some color.

11:35.710 --> 11:44.380
Let's give it orange save this refresh our page and we can see now we selected any anchor tag with this

11:44.380 --> 11:50.160
particular ref inside of a list and changes color and it's border.

11:50.210 --> 11:50.570
All right.

11:50.570 --> 11:54.040
So that's really all there is for these particular CSA selectors.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.480
They're at the course the most common ones we're going to be dealing with are really class selectors

11:58.790 --> 12:00.410
and Id selectors.

12:00.620 --> 12:07.280
Well we will show various things such as Jason's siblings or the ascendence attributes et cetera these

12:07.280 --> 12:12.170
throughout our course are going to be less commonly used just because we won't be really focusing on

12:12.200 --> 12:14.720
those type of my new details we're learning.

12:14.720 --> 12:20.660
We will really more focused on classes and ideas so make sure you really know these two types.

12:20.710 --> 12:21.870
Right classes.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.530
Hash tag for IDs.

12:23.630 --> 12:24.080
OK.

12:24.110 --> 12:29.630
And if you ever want to reference the various other type to see selectors just open up the CSSA file

12:29.630 --> 12:33.980
and it has links to the SS reference selector pages.

12:33.980 --> 12:35.890
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

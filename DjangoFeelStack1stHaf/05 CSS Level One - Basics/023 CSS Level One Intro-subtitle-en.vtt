Hello everyone and welcome to the CSSA level one section of the course.

00:09.590 --> 00:15.530
We've now completed h T.M. both sections and it's time to move on to learning about CSSA and the SS

00:15.620 --> 00:18.570
will have two sections to it Level 1 and level 2.

00:18.710 --> 00:24.950
CSA stands for cascading style sheets and CSSA really describes how Timah elements are displayed on

00:24.950 --> 00:29.990
the page and we're going to take this lecture to describe what's the SS is and show you some examples

00:30.080 --> 00:37.070
of its true power so styling can affect many things such as color font size borders and many more properties

00:37.100 --> 00:38.420
of h m l.

00:38.450 --> 00:43.220
So far I've been able to create basic h tim l documents while they may have some content and a little

00:43.220 --> 00:44.330
bit of functionality.

00:44.330 --> 00:49.070
They basically all look the same and when you're actually on the web you want things to look nice and

00:49.100 --> 00:55.160
usually the fine styling outside of the html file you create a separate CSSA file and then link that

00:55.170 --> 00:56.540
to the HTML file.

00:56.540 --> 01:01.100
We're going to show later on some examples that you can actually find styling within the HTML document

01:01.100 --> 01:01.710
itself.

01:01.790 --> 01:06.710
But it's a much more common and better practice to separate your styling into a CSSA file and then link

01:06.710 --> 01:10.220
it to the html file in the head of that a small file document.

01:10.220 --> 01:14.020
And that's where we're going to be discussing that meta data OK.

01:14.150 --> 01:16.980
Let's show a quick example of just how powerful CSSA can be.

01:17.060 --> 01:20.710
Exploring the same HMO code but with different CSSA linked to it.

01:20.780 --> 01:25.400
Let me go to this link right here if you can find that just by googling W3 schools see SS and there's

01:25.400 --> 01:27.920
actually lots of Web sites that show similar examples of this.

01:28.070 --> 01:32.310
So you can just google search CSSA demos and you'll find lots of Web sites like this one.

01:32.340 --> 01:34.570
To open my browser and jump to this link.

01:34.910 --> 01:40.550
Ok here I am at my browser and I've come to the W3 schools dot com Web site that has CSSA introduction

01:40.970 --> 01:45.260
and you'll notice here on the left hand panel is actually a really nice reference to a bunch of CSSA

01:45.980 --> 01:49.020
topics such as outlines text fonts etc..

01:49.130 --> 01:53.690
We're going to be covering a lot of these but throughout the course if you feel like you need more reference

01:53.960 --> 01:57.190
you can just visit W3 school ZCom on CSSA.

01:57.290 --> 02:02.420
Another Web site I want to mention that I like probably a little better than W3 schools is the Mozilla

02:02.420 --> 02:03.230
developer network.

02:03.230 --> 02:08.780
They also have a ton of information about cascading style sheets or CSSA they have tutorials introduction

02:08.780 --> 02:11.840
reference and as you become more of a developer.

02:11.900 --> 02:15.610
As you already learned the tools you'll probably be using the reference more than the tutorials and

02:15.610 --> 02:16.920
introduction sections.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.910
So just keep that in mind these are two really great links for you to check out.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.590
In case you want to dive deeper into some of the stuff we talk about during this course but I just want

02:24.590 --> 02:29.540
to show you the s.c.s introduction page which actually has a kind of a fun demo so you can see what

02:29.540 --> 02:31.850
a simple page with multiple styles.

02:31.910 --> 02:39.200
Notice if you scroll down here it says Welcome to my home page and this is HVM L that's linked to SS

02:39.740 --> 02:43.320
and you'll notice we see that we have the screen header bar.

02:43.320 --> 02:45.130
You have some different fonts etc..

02:45.140 --> 02:50.380
A little sidebar but we also have these links to different stylesheets and if I click on one of these

02:50.390 --> 02:54.870
links to style sheet number 2 for instance you'll notice the website completely changes.

02:54.980 --> 03:00.080
But the fun fact to know here is that this is actually the exact same h HTML code.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.830
The only thing that's changing is the CSSA file that it's linked to.

03:03.830 --> 03:09.620
So all the changes you see here when you hit on the stylesheets is just sheer CSSA none of the Himself

03:09.670 --> 03:13.460
is changing the content changing just the CSSA changing itself.

03:13.640 --> 03:18.770
And they can really see me cook Ancel shoot for here just how powerful CSSA is it can make your website

03:18.770 --> 03:20.330
look completely different.

03:20.330 --> 03:23.600
Using the same content and if we click on No stylesheet.

03:23.750 --> 03:29.150
This is what we've been working with just pure H Tim L So the same page just different stylesheets.

03:29.220 --> 03:32.100
There's no stylesheet you can see as you play around with these.

03:32.120 --> 03:35.960
You can get a vastly different looking website with all the style sheets.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.640
And after these two CSSA level 1 and level 2 sections are going to be learning about Bootstrap which

03:40.640 --> 03:43.820
helps streamline a lot of this process and take care.

03:43.850 --> 03:45.290
A lot of the work for you.

03:45.320 --> 03:50.450
But before we hit bootstrap we really should understand CSSA itself that way if we ever need to customize

03:50.450 --> 03:54.050
anything we can do that before we just jump straight into bootstrap.

03:54.080 --> 03:58.160
OK so let's continue on and start learning about the basics of SS.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.050
Thanks everyone and I'll see in the next lecture.

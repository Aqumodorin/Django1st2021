00:05.070 --> 00:08.620
Hello everyone and welcome to part one of CSSA level one.

00:08.790 --> 00:13.290
I just wanted to quickly point out in the section of the course the notes are divided up into parts

00:13.290 --> 00:16.630
1 through 5 and then we have a final level one assessment.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.940
Each part consists of an eighth HTML file and a CSSA file.

00:19.950 --> 00:24.750
So for example you may have something like Part 1 that age html and then Part 1 underscore master that

00:24.760 --> 00:25.270
CSC.

00:25.300 --> 00:29.910
So those two files are meant to go together and be linked together and you can refer to the contents

00:30.150 --> 00:32.890
of the CSSA level one folder for more information.

00:33.330 --> 00:38.340
OK let's get started with Part 1 where we begin to discuss the very basics of CSSA and how we can link

00:38.340 --> 00:42.540
it to an aged female file going to jump to the Adam text editor to get started.

00:42.540 --> 00:45.510
All right so here I have my editor open as well as my browser.

00:45.540 --> 00:49.750
I've created a new folder called CSSA level 1 and they have two files in it.

00:49.810 --> 00:55.740
One that each T.M. and part 1 underscore mastered that C Ss and will be Typee encoding these out if

00:55.740 --> 00:57.270
you want the completed versions.

00:57.270 --> 01:00.730
Just check the CSSA level one folder from the download.

01:00.750 --> 01:01.110
All right.

01:01.110 --> 01:07.320
Moving along a quick note it's unusual to have a digit or a number inside the name of a CSSA reached

01:07.320 --> 01:07.570
him.

01:07.590 --> 01:08.280
File.

01:08.280 --> 01:12.840
I'm just leaving them there so it's clear which ones match up with the course notes and parts.

01:13.020 --> 01:18.030
But usually you wouldn't actually have a digit or number inside the name of an email or the SS file.

01:18.030 --> 01:23.280
So I just wanted to quickly note that lets start off by making a very basic ASML page and that will

01:23.280 --> 01:26.610
show how we can link stuff in the CSSA file to it.

01:26.640 --> 01:32.270
So right now I have hurt one that asked him open all h t m l and I'm going to collapse the directory.

01:32.280 --> 01:40.000
Just control or command backslash there and we'll just make this called C Ss basics and the title will

01:40.050 --> 01:45.720
save that and then in the body I'm going to have a heading in this heading is just going to say this

01:45.720 --> 01:54.140
is the heading and will have a paragraph as well in the body and it's going to just say let's see a

01:54.140 --> 02:02.300
list and then let's just create an ordered list o l where each item has a list item tag line will have

02:02.300 --> 02:03.020
item 1.

02:03.070 --> 02:05.300
Now let's make two more items in this list.

02:07.010 --> 02:10.530
Item 2 ally.

02:10.610 --> 02:11.590
Enter there and then.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.490
Item 3.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.050
OK let's save that.

02:15.050 --> 02:17.420
Refresh our browser over here.

02:17.420 --> 02:17.990
Looks good.

02:18.020 --> 02:20.320
I can zoom in a little bit so we can see it better.

02:20.990 --> 02:22.040
Ok so I have the heading.

02:22.040 --> 02:29.250
Let's see a list item one item to item 3 and lets on the bottom say a heading for.

02:29.450 --> 02:35.070
This is adding for save that refresh.

02:35.110 --> 02:38.200
Now we see at the bottom we have heading for perfect.

02:38.280 --> 02:43.850
Now we want to learn how we can actually connect styles to this same old document.

02:44.860 --> 02:49.790
And that is where the head portion of the HVM document comes into play.

02:49.810 --> 02:56.110
What we need to do is use a special keyword tag called link you'll see as I begin to type it.

02:56.110 --> 03:02.680
I can hit enter and I get a link here and by default it says the relationship of this link is a stylesheet

03:03.040 --> 03:08.950
and then we have a Tref which is going to be the actual path to this CSSA file and in our case it's

03:08.950 --> 03:16.960
called Part 1 underscore M. that C Ss and we can just use Part 1 underscore M. that CSSA.

03:17.020 --> 03:21.970
If it was located somewhere else on my computer I'd have to type in the whole file path or make a reference

03:21.970 --> 03:23.080
to the whole file path.

03:23.230 --> 03:27.820
But these two files are in the same directory so I can just write part 1 underscore master that see

03:27.850 --> 03:33.970
SS and I also want to make sure that I specify that it's a style sheet and then I click save here and

03:33.970 --> 03:40.090
if I refresh I won't notice anything different but now my document is linked to my style sheet.

03:40.390 --> 03:41.940
So let's jump to the style sheet.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.740
The start see SS and get started.

03:44.860 --> 03:46.570
First let's show the basics.

03:46.720 --> 03:54.370
If I want to make a comment it's just a forward slash Asterix and then anything you type in between

03:54.550 --> 04:01.240
two of those so then another Asterix forward slash is a comment and just like we did of H Tim L I can

04:01.240 --> 04:08.650
type some text so will say some text and that I can do control forward slash.

04:08.680 --> 04:12.510
It automatically makes that into a comment so you can save yourself some time there.

04:12.550 --> 04:18.400
That also works for a multi-line So if I have some text on multiple lines I can highlight all of this

04:18.800 --> 04:24.700
control or command forward slash and it will automatically make that all into a comment and it's always

04:24.700 --> 04:26.150
good to calmy your code.

04:26.230 --> 04:28.510
If you come back to a later time.

04:28.510 --> 04:33.730
Now let's discuss the general form of SS The general form look something like this.

04:33.790 --> 04:44.440
You have some sort of selected tag then curly braces inside these curly braces are going to have some

04:44.440 --> 04:51.850
property a colon and then some value for that property in a semi-colon.

04:51.850 --> 04:56.390
So that's going to be the very basic format for a CSSA file.

04:56.440 --> 05:01.140
I wanted to comment that out and actually show you an example of one.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.970
So let's think of a selected tag.

05:02.970 --> 05:08.460
If I look back to my H.T. mail file I know that I have H-1 as a possible tag.

05:08.460 --> 05:12.280
So let's grab that tag by typing in H-1.

05:12.570 --> 05:16.200
I put in curly brackets and I can zoom in here a little bit so it's a little clearer.

05:16.470 --> 05:22.800
And then I want a property of H-1 and one of the first properties are going to be working with is the

05:22.800 --> 05:27.600
color property and you can see here that as I begin to type stuff in the CSSA file.

05:27.690 --> 05:29.400
Adam text editor is actually trying to help me out.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.380
Like oh you want color you want columns.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.920
Column count etc..

05:33.120 --> 05:36.840
So we just want color so I can actually hit enter there and all begin.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.190
Help me out here with this.

05:38.190 --> 05:42.180
So I want color and then I can state the actual color I want in this case.

05:42.180 --> 05:46.310
I want the color to be blue and then a semi-colon.

05:46.330 --> 05:53.370
And you notice what happened as I was typing the color itself for instance purple it doesn't turn yellow

05:53.380 --> 05:56.640
that syntax highlighting until it's a color that works.

05:56.640 --> 06:03.690
Now there are actually a lot of colors that CSSA already knows just by their name things such as basic

06:03.690 --> 06:10.140
colors like red green black orange purple etc. later on where you'll learn how to actually passen color

06:10.140 --> 06:10.580
codes.

06:10.590 --> 06:15.870
But right now we're going to keep things really simple and just make this blue.

06:16.040 --> 06:20.880
So let's save this and see what happens when we refresh our page.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.160
And now you notice that this is the heading.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.170
Anything with the H-1 tag.

06:25.390 --> 06:27.830
Now has the color blue.

06:28.210 --> 06:33.130
And that's the very basic idea of how C Ss works.

06:33.130 --> 06:38.930
So you just have whatever tag you want to effect in the female the property of that age T.M..

06:39.310 --> 06:41.790
And then what you want to change the property to.

06:41.950 --> 06:47.230
There are a ton of properties you can edit using CSSA connected to your HTML file.

06:47.260 --> 06:51.010
One of the most basic ones so we've covered already is color and we're going to show you right now in

06:51.010 --> 06:57.830
this lecture various ways to change the color using not just key words but also code such as in our

06:57.830 --> 07:02.900
G-B code in our G-B code and a hex code and we'll discuss what those are in just a little bit.

07:02.920 --> 07:07.840
But don't worry too much right now about having to memorize all the various properties that are available

07:07.840 --> 07:14.170
to you as we go through CSSA level 1 and see esus level 2 you're going to begin to naturally stand what

07:14.170 --> 07:15.340
properties you want to affect.

07:15.340 --> 07:17.650
Using C Ss for this lecture.

07:17.680 --> 07:24.970
All I want you to get out of it is the general format of CSX which is the tag name the curly braces

07:25.060 --> 07:26.720
and then the property.

07:26.770 --> 07:32.890
And what you want the property value to be and how to link CSSA to H.T. mail file and the different

07:32.890 --> 07:35.140
ways to change color.

07:35.140 --> 07:38.890
So we've already learned how to link the H.T. mail file member that was just this link tag.

07:39.040 --> 07:44.160
We've already learned the basic method of CSSA which is this tag curly braces.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.230
And then property value.

07:46.390 --> 07:50.290
So let's continue to explore the different ways we can effect color.

07:50.290 --> 07:55.960
So so far we learn that there are certain keywords very common colors are available for us if I make

07:55.960 --> 07:59.140
this red save this refresh on my page.

07:59.140 --> 08:01.250
Now this is the heading is read.

08:01.570 --> 08:04.100
So let's explore some more of this.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.710
I'm going to put another tag in.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.450
So that's going to affect all elements of the tag.

08:09.610 --> 08:10.790
I remember that's item one.

08:10.810 --> 08:19.560
Item 2 an item 3 let's call color now let's make these green save it refresh over here.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.810
Now I can see the item one item tonight.

08:21.850 --> 08:26.560
Three are green but there are other ways to do colors.

08:26.560 --> 08:30.790
You don't just have to use colored anes because maybe you want your own custom color a certain shade

08:30.790 --> 08:33.600
of blue a certain shade of red etc. you can do.

08:33.610 --> 08:35.930
RG codes.

08:36.050 --> 08:39.680
Let's explore a little bit more about what R.G. be codes look like.

08:39.710 --> 08:50.130
I take my browser and expand it and I go to Google then here in Google I can search for RSGB enter and

08:50.130 --> 08:58.280
I get this RG color model and then I can also do RSGB picker and notice that some of the top links are

08:58.280 --> 09:02.160
color pictures that will be three schools are to be color code charts.

09:02.210 --> 09:03.880
Any of these will work just fine.

09:03.890 --> 09:10.030
They can click on color picker that come basically here we have a what's known as a color picker ZF-I

09:10.120 --> 09:11.650
zoom in a bit.

09:11.650 --> 09:13.600
You may be familiar with something that looks like this.

09:13.600 --> 09:17.650
Remember we actually saw our own colored picker back when we were working of HMO.

09:17.850 --> 09:23.380
But here you just select whatever color you want based off what looks good to you visually and you can

09:23.380 --> 09:28.420
get the actual R.G. B code and you can also get hex codes if we're going to talk about it just a little

09:28.420 --> 09:28.910
bit.

09:29.290 --> 09:36.940
But if you notice we go back to Google and just search for color picker than Google itself will actually

09:36.940 --> 09:39.260
show you the values here.

09:39.310 --> 09:44.880
So I like using Google's own color pictures just google searching for color picker actually brings R.G.

09:44.940 --> 09:48.890
B and this hex code for you which we're going to discuss just a little bit.

09:49.090 --> 09:52.060
But let's say I wanted a specific shade of green.

09:52.060 --> 09:57.330
I saw the basic green we had but let's say I want kind of a more forest green a little darker.

09:57.370 --> 10:02.170
So I come down here I pick the color I like and I know these color numbers right here.

10:02.170 --> 10:07.060
This basically is a representation of how much red is in the color how much green is in the color and

10:07.060 --> 10:08.220
how much blue is in the color.

10:08.230 --> 10:09.700
That's why it's called r.g.

10:09.940 --> 10:16.550
So I can come back here and in this RSGB I will put those numbers so it was eight to me back here 84

10:16.600 --> 10:17.570
in one.

10:18.010 --> 10:21.960
So eight's 84 and 1.

10:22.070 --> 10:26.810
And notice once it's complete everything is now the same teal colors for syntax highlighting.

10:26.980 --> 10:34.140
So I will save this come back here and refresh and might not be too noticeable on your screen but I

10:34.140 --> 10:37.570
can see that this is a nice darker green.

10:37.880 --> 10:43.590
And just to make it really obvious we'll come and choose a brighter colors so let's go from dark green

10:43.590 --> 10:46.370
to maybe some bright orange to come back to color picker.

10:46.410 --> 10:47.260
Play around with this.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.820
Maybe choose this really bright orange over here.

10:49.920 --> 10:52.850
That's 2 5 5 9 7 0.

10:52.890 --> 11:00.100
I'll copy that person in here to 5:5 red 97 green 0 blue.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.590
I will save my CSSA file to save those changes.

11:03.720 --> 11:04.360
Refresh.

11:04.380 --> 11:06.990
Now I see the list items have definitely changed.

11:06.990 --> 11:08.830
Item one item to item 3.

11:09.180 --> 11:09.480
All right.

11:09.540 --> 11:12.830
Let's explore two more methods of changing color.

11:13.050 --> 11:15.200
So I will grab this.

11:15.210 --> 11:17.940
Let's see a list which is or just a paragraph.

11:17.940 --> 11:26.950
So I say P curly braces call the color property and now I want to show you how to use hex codes and

11:26.950 --> 11:33.170
hex codes are basically just another way of displaying the color than an actual code value.

11:33.190 --> 11:35.980
So let's make it into kind of a nice blue.

11:36.010 --> 11:38.800
Hopefully these are showing up well on your screen.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.190
So I like the shade of blue.

11:40.240 --> 11:45.760
I copy and paste this hex code and make sure it has this hash tag symbol in front of it.

11:45.850 --> 11:53.860
Paste it in here and then a semi-colon to save this and then I will come back here to see if this basic's

11:53.860 --> 11:54.890
refresh.

11:54.890 --> 12:00.580
And now I see that the paragraph or anything of that paragraph tag has been changed to have a blue color

12:00.760 --> 12:02.660
that specific blue that I chose.

12:02.710 --> 12:05.210
So that's just another way of coding out a color you have.

12:05.230 --> 12:09.240
RG B red green blue and yellow hex codes.

12:09.250 --> 12:13.240
Finally I want to show you one last way and I will do it for heading for.

12:13.530 --> 12:20.390
And it's really similar to R.G. B except it's R.G. B.A.A. and the difference between RSGB which is red

12:20.450 --> 12:26.230
green blue and are G.P.A. which looks like this color.

12:27.290 --> 12:36.640
And then it's going to have four inputs is that R.G. is just red green blue R-GA is red green blue and

12:36.650 --> 12:38.040
a term called Alpha.

12:38.060 --> 12:42.290
And if you've done any sort of data visualization before you'll be familiar with Alpha where the alpha

12:42.290 --> 12:49.730
parameter is a number between 0 and 1 or 0 stands for fully transparent and one that stands for fully

12:49.730 --> 12:50.600
opaque.

12:50.600 --> 12:57.530
So you can think of that second or last a value that Alpha value is just clarifying how dark or how

12:57.530 --> 12:59.590
transparent this color is.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.380
So let's come back up here.

13:01.490 --> 13:05.610
Choose these values the same values and then input.

13:05.870 --> 13:08.930
Let's say 0.5 for our color.

13:08.940 --> 13:15.740
So we'll save that come back to heading for refreshed so we can see here at 0.5 the orange is a little

13:15.740 --> 13:16.530
lighter.

13:16.640 --> 13:25.610
If I go all the way to 1 and I save this refresh here then I can see that I have basically the darkest

13:25.610 --> 13:27.140
possible version of this.

13:27.140 --> 13:34.070
RG B it's fully opaque and that should match up with the normal R.G. be so be with a or alpha being

13:34.070 --> 13:43.240
one is the exact same thing as R.G. B and F I make this zero and say refresh that I can see that it's

13:43.240 --> 13:44.460
fully transparent.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.290
So I want to highlight it.

13:45.310 --> 13:48.130
I can see it but with zero it's fully transparent.

13:48.130 --> 13:54.730
So again our GPA really similar to our D-B except a this last term just defines how transparent it is

13:54.730 --> 13:58.280
with 0 being fully transparent and one being fully opaque.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.030
OK.

13:59.290 --> 14:01.850
So that's it as far as this part one.

14:01.900 --> 14:07.600
What we've learned so far is how to connect CSSA to each T.M. the general format for a CSSA select the

14:07.600 --> 14:12.820
tag property value mechanism and then how we can affect colors throughout the course.

14:12.820 --> 14:16.490
Probably the most common color method we're going to be using are hex codes.

14:16.710 --> 14:19.390
And that's probably what you see most commonly these days.

14:19.450 --> 14:21.900
You also see R.G. be quite a lot R-Ga..

14:22.120 --> 14:28.420
It's not very common unless you're doing a very quick Web site so you just directly call a letter name

14:28.450 --> 14:33.910
colors like red purple green etc. but for really quick jobs you may want to do that because it's much

14:33.940 --> 14:36.200
easier but usually you see hex codes.

14:36.510 --> 14:38.080
OK thanks everyone.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.960
And if you have any questions feel free to post them to the Kewney forums.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.050
I'll see you at the next lecture.

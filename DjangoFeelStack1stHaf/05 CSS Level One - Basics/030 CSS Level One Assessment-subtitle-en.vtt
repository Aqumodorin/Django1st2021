Hello everyone and welcome to the CSSA level on assessment for this assessment.

00:10.360 --> 00:14.090
You will be given an h t m l file it's actually already filled out with content.

00:14.260 --> 00:20.440
It will be your task to edit in additional CSSA file to make the age T.M. look like the solution CSSA

00:20.440 --> 00:21.920
version.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.580
So there's going to be three files you need to actually complete this.

00:25.670 --> 00:30.280
You're going to need to grab from the C as it's level 1 folder these three files right here the level

00:30.280 --> 00:36.070
on assessment see assess level an assessment HVM L and then the test solutions see a SS file.

00:36.290 --> 00:40.870
Let's explore the assessment and explain how these three files are going to work.

00:41.760 --> 00:46.380
All right so here we have my editor open as well as my browser and I have downloaded the three files

00:46.380 --> 00:47.070
I need.

00:47.070 --> 00:52.610
The assessment that the SS file the assessment team T.M. file and then the solutions that CSSA file.

00:52.650 --> 00:58.890
So if I open up those files and take a look at first the M L file so C is s level 1 assessment that

00:58.890 --> 00:59.970
h m l.

00:59.970 --> 01:04.370
This is basically HTL file that we're going to be working with with C Ss.

01:04.470 --> 01:08.670
So for this test you're actually not going to be editing any aged him out but instead you're going to

01:08.670 --> 01:12.120
be editing a C S file it's link to this T.M..

01:12.240 --> 01:19.200
So what we can do right now is just comments out with control or command forward slash any link to the

01:19.200 --> 01:21.670
CSSA refresh this assessment test.

01:21.870 --> 01:24.900
And this is what it looks like at first it says Welcome to the free blog.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.490
Thanks so much for visiting the site.

01:26.490 --> 01:27.540
What is this site for.

01:27.540 --> 01:30.730
Etc. and you see there's a link here that takes you to Google.

01:30.780 --> 01:32.870
We can expand this text area.

01:33.030 --> 01:36.850
Please log in to save your post etc. questions or comments sent feedback here.

01:36.990 --> 01:37.230
All right.

01:37.260 --> 01:43.680
So we see we have a very basic html site if we undo the link to the solutions that we assess and then

01:43.680 --> 01:45.030
refresh this.

01:45.090 --> 01:49.410
We can see that there's a ton of styling here so we've given stuff boarder's stuff background change

01:49.410 --> 01:52.990
the font color changed some borders down here etc..

01:53.070 --> 01:56.380
So this Web site is not meant to look better.

01:56.430 --> 02:01.860
In fact I would say it looks worse than it did without the C Ss but it's meant for you to practice various

02:01.860 --> 02:04.600
aspects of C Ss that we learn in level 1.

02:04.650 --> 02:08.880
So what you'll end up doing is once you've opened up the safety mail file you're going to change the

02:08.880 --> 02:09.770
reference.

02:09.870 --> 02:13.670
Apart from the solutions back to your assessment.

02:13.740 --> 02:22.140
So you say see a little one test or level one and you will then make sure it matches the SS file.

02:22.140 --> 02:26.880
You're going to be filling out which is C Level 1 assessment.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.070
Save that refreshed this and right now it's blank.

02:30.070 --> 02:33.840
So now if we go to this file CSSA want assessment that see SS.

02:33.840 --> 02:39.120
We click on it and we notice here that we actually have a bunch of comments in it and basically for

02:39.120 --> 02:42.330
this test what you're going to be doing is just doing the tasks here.

02:42.330 --> 02:48.520
So for instance it says give the body element of the site a light blue background using a hex code.

02:48.810 --> 02:53.910
So remember just to do this first task to kind of walk you through what the assessment will be like

02:54.360 --> 02:55.070
you'll fall.

02:55.080 --> 02:56.430
So it says give the body element.

02:56.470 --> 03:03.150
OK so I know I want to grab the body and give it a light blue background so I'll say something like

03:03.150 --> 03:09.030
background color and if I wanted it to be dark blue or just a normal blue I would say something like

03:09.030 --> 03:09.970
this blue.

03:10.070 --> 03:15.170
If I refreshed this now everything is blue but you'll have to do when you start this task.

03:15.210 --> 03:17.040
Is use a hex code to do this.

03:17.070 --> 03:21.540
So you wants to be a light blue background color using a hex code and don't worry about any particular

03:21.540 --> 03:22.520
shade of light blue.

03:22.620 --> 03:23.540
It's really up to you.

03:23.610 --> 03:29.190
And then you have test to change each one to have a one pixel solid black border etc. so you can see

03:29.190 --> 03:34.560
here you're going to be editing this assess a little by little until it essentially matches what looks

03:34.560 --> 03:35.660
like the solutions.

03:35.700 --> 03:36.130
OK.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.170
And at the very end there's a bonus challenge and you can.

03:39.300 --> 03:43.080
There's a link to Google here that will say a little.

03:43.080 --> 03:43.980
Hence the challenge.

03:43.980 --> 03:45.370
But don't worry about it too much.

03:45.390 --> 03:50.520
Basically just complete tasks 1 through 9 and then the next lecture actually going to be coding through

03:50.520 --> 03:51.090
the solution.

03:51.090 --> 03:53.960
So again you're just working of the CSSA file here.

03:54.090 --> 03:58.590
That's connected to the assessment that if you ever need a refresher on what the final product essentially

03:58.590 --> 04:02.680
looks like reconnects this email file to the solutions.

04:02.680 --> 04:06.310
What I don't want you to do is just immediately open this solution see SS file.

04:06.330 --> 04:10.310
Don't do that until you've given your best shot to the assessment test.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.020
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

Hello everyone and welcome to part two connecting javascript.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.520
We learned quite a bit in the last lecture.

00:11.530 --> 00:16.090
So let's take a little bit of a break and just show you how you can connect a javascript file which

00:16.090 --> 00:19.890
is a genius extension file to an h l File.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.300
We're going to open up Adam and the browser for this.

00:22.300 --> 00:24.300
So let's hop over to them now.

00:24.580 --> 00:30.980
OK so here we have Adam text editor open and in the Adam text editor I have two files and empty HTL

00:31.000 --> 00:38.980
files called example that Tim L and a file called my script dot Jess which is also empty at this time.

00:38.980 --> 00:46.240
So what I will begin doing is typing out each team just so we get some basic h tim L here in the Heading

00:46.240 --> 00:51.160
1 and say something like welcome to your bank.

00:51.850 --> 00:55.960
Let's save that and check that it's connected to our browser by refreshing the page.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.990
And here we see welcome to your bank.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.520
Now let's show you how you can actually connect a javascript file for each HTML file.

01:02.710 --> 01:05.200
And this works with the script tag.

01:05.200 --> 01:12.580
So up here we can type script inside of the script tag the open tag and looing to write S or C for source

01:13.030 --> 01:18.280
and then actually input the source of my scripts and those scores from my script.

01:18.280 --> 01:27.970
It's just my script that jacks in it goes in quotes and then we have a close in tanks so it looks like

01:28.120 --> 01:29.090
this.

01:29.440 --> 01:35.740
And you can actually use ATOM to automate this so if I begin to type script here and hit enter you'll

01:35.740 --> 01:37.660
actually get this auto pop up here.

01:37.660 --> 01:40.030
You don't have to really worry about type at this point in time.

01:40.240 --> 01:43.430
So you could just use that as well for the autocomplete.

01:43.450 --> 01:48.660
But basically we're looking for here is just a script that where the first open secret tag has the R

01:48.700 --> 01:54.470
C or the source and pointing to your doc js file and right now these are both in the same directory.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.980
So all I have to do is provide the name.

01:57.010 --> 02:03.120
Now it's actually add some stuff to the Jazz file so we can clarify and check that it's actually working.

02:03.130 --> 02:09.640
So the very first thing I want to do here is in this javascript file I'll put an alert that says Welcome

02:09.640 --> 02:10.980
to your bank

02:13.860 --> 02:20.050
and I will save that and let's refresh this page and we should now upon refreshing see an alert that

02:20.050 --> 02:24.840
says This page says Welcome to your bank and we'll hit OK and no.

02:24.850 --> 02:30.830
Over here in the H Tim L that I'm calling my script before I'm calling anything else in the body.

02:30.910 --> 02:36.280
So the reason that this appeared blank for a second is because I was calling my script before I called

02:36.280 --> 02:42.400
anything in my body and we'll discuss later on what script placement and where it should go has an effect

02:42.520 --> 02:43.090
on your age.

02:43.090 --> 02:47.560
Tim L. But let's continue on with this javascript file.

02:47.770 --> 02:49.600
We'll continue on to her big example.

02:49.660 --> 02:54.590
And going to create a variable called the posit.

02:54.610 --> 03:03.250
And that's going to be a prompt saying how much would you like to deposit today.

03:03.680 --> 03:08.170
Questionmark and then let's say alerts

03:10.850 --> 03:18.970
you of the posited and then we're going to concatenate the actual deposit amount

03:21.900 --> 03:24.430
and then I'm also going to do a console log.

03:24.570 --> 03:29.490
So I will say cancel that log and we'll put something like.

03:29.610 --> 03:39.910
You are a cool person so let's save that refresh our page to reload this javascript and now it says

03:39.910 --> 03:41.270
Welcome to your bank.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.420
OK.

03:42.490 --> 03:45.200
And then it says how much would you like to deposit today.

03:45.610 --> 03:46.900
Let's put in 100.

03:46.930 --> 03:47.840
Click OK.

03:47.890 --> 03:48.580
We get an alert.

03:48.610 --> 03:51.010
It says you've deposited 100.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.680
Now we also had that console log.

03:52.780 --> 03:58.940
So I can check by right clicking saying inspect and here on the console.

03:58.990 --> 04:01.630
I see you are a cool person.

04:01.630 --> 04:02.140
Great.

04:02.320 --> 04:07.020
So that's really all there is as far as connecting a javascript file to NHT mail file.

04:07.030 --> 04:10.930
Again the main thing I want you to get out of this is that there's a script tag and you can connect

04:10.930 --> 04:15.780
it to your javascript source and then whatever javascript you have here will be uploaded.

04:15.790 --> 04:20.160
Whenever you refresh the page or when you actually just visit the page for the first time.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.880
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

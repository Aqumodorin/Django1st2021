Hello everyone and welcome to the solutions lecture.

00:07.870 --> 00:12.770
For the first javascript exercise and part three let's hop to the editor and get started.

00:13.020 --> 00:19.680
OK so here have my text editor of the HTML document open and I've linked it to my script Jap's in my

00:19.680 --> 00:21.490
script that just is currently empty.

00:21.540 --> 00:25.080
So right now if I refresh this page nothing actually happens.

00:25.080 --> 00:28.990
So let's actually add in the logic that we need to convert this.

00:29.150 --> 00:37.170
So I'm going to create a variable Elba's for pounds and I'm going to set it equal to the prompt which

00:37.170 --> 00:47.930
asks way in pounds questionmark than what I'm going to do is create other variable called kilogrammes

00:47.930 --> 00:57.730
for K.G. which is equal to the variable LDS or Pownce times zero point 4 5 for.

00:57.920 --> 01:08.840
And then I'm going to alert the user that is now let's concatenate it with the kilograms E.A.G. plus

01:09.140 --> 01:17.700
and then say kilogrammes and note my spacing here that we it actually reads nicely and let's add some

01:17.700 --> 01:21.540
semi colons here and we're going to talk more about semi-colons later on.

01:21.540 --> 01:26.010
It's actually not necessary to have them here on each line but it's good practice.

01:26.190 --> 01:28.970
And then we're going to add in a log to this.

01:28.980 --> 01:34.080
So if you just start typing log you'll actually get the whole consulate log there.

01:34.440 --> 01:35.670
And I will say conversion

01:39.440 --> 01:46.010
Sadowitz refresh this page and see what happens says wait impounds I'll say 100 lbs tells me it's forty

01:46.010 --> 01:51.470
five point four kilograms OK and I get conversion complete at the bottom and that's really all there

01:51.470 --> 01:52.070
was to it.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.740
So again just four lines of Javascript.

01:54.740 --> 02:00.020
And hopefully now you feel really comfortable setting a variable using prompt using alert and using

02:00.020 --> 02:04.060
council that log if you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

02:04.110 --> 02:05.510
I'll see all at the next lecture.

Hello everyone and welcome to part three.

00:06.990 --> 00:09.530
Your first javascript exercise.

00:09.910 --> 00:12.250
Let's get some practice of your new skills.

00:12.250 --> 00:17.530
You're going to be creating a very simple web site that takes an A waits in imperial pounds and converts

00:17.530 --> 00:21.320
it to kilogrammes the H-2A mail is already done.

00:21.360 --> 00:27.120
All your work will just be in the connected not just file and the files can be found under javascript.

00:27.120 --> 00:32.350
Level one folder and they're called Part 3 underscore exercise that each team L and part 3.

00:32.370 --> 00:33.810
J.S..

00:34.080 --> 00:39.330
So at the bottom of the html file is the connection to the solution that js file which is part 3 that

00:39.330 --> 00:40.080
js.

00:40.260 --> 00:42.560
Make sure to actually change that to your own.

00:42.650 --> 00:44.630
Yes file before you start.

00:44.640 --> 00:49.040
Let's quickly explore the HTML file and what the sexercise actually looks like.

00:49.080 --> 00:54.790
Going to hop over to the editor in browser now OK here you have my editor open as well as the browser

00:54.810 --> 01:00.090
connected to the H Tim L file and the instructions for the exercise are actually already embedded into

01:00.090 --> 01:05.250
this aist him file like image and you're going to be creating a weight metric converter taken a number

01:05.250 --> 01:07.650
in pounds and convert it to kilograms.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.570
And what you're going to be doing is.

01:09.590 --> 01:16.350
First you need to grab the Tamil file in all the way down at the bottom we have the script and the reason

01:16.350 --> 01:22.840
the script is at the bottom is because I want him to load before my script actually loads.

01:23.070 --> 01:28.110
So I have the script here and right now it's connected to my own script my script that G-S.

01:28.260 --> 01:31.560
But when you first open this file it's going to be connected to part 3.

01:31.620 --> 01:33.270
Yes that is the solution.

01:33.270 --> 01:34.510
Javascript file.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.450
So if you want you can run this.

01:36.450 --> 01:39.790
H TIM PAGE ONE time so you can see what the solution looks like.

01:39.870 --> 01:44.340
As far as its interaction with the Web site but make sure when you're actually programming your javascript

01:44.580 --> 01:47.900
you remember to change the source to your own solution.

01:47.910 --> 01:53.940
Ok so like I said you first want to actually change the script here so it links to your work.

01:54.030 --> 01:57.670
Then use javascript to accept a number and put in pounds.

01:57.800 --> 02:02.490
Then in your JIT javascript file convert this number to kilogrammes and the conversion from pounds to

02:02.490 --> 02:03.900
kilograms is right here.

02:03.900 --> 02:10.920
You multiply it by 0.4 5:4 and then afterwards report back in an alert that the way is now in kilogrammes

02:11.010 --> 02:16.710
and then log slash write conversion completed to the Consul's second Z here conversion complete in the

02:16.710 --> 02:17.550
console.

02:17.550 --> 02:20.500
Let me refresh the page and show you what this should all look like.

02:20.550 --> 02:25.940
Once you've come up with your solution a refresh and we see here it says what is the weight in pounds.

02:25.950 --> 02:28.690
So put in one hundred pounds.

02:28.770 --> 02:30.990
Click OK and then report back.

02:30.990 --> 02:33.660
That is forty five point four kilograms.

02:33.810 --> 02:36.290
OK and down here at the con..

02:36.300 --> 02:39.220
I see conversion completed has been logged.

02:39.570 --> 02:40.170
All right.

02:40.170 --> 02:41.790
This is a fairly simple exercise.

02:41.790 --> 02:45.390
It's actually just a few lines of javascript code that gets stuck on anything.

02:45.390 --> 02:48.980
Feel free to post the Kewney forums or just watch the next lecture.

02:48.990 --> 02:50.730
I will code through the solutions.

02:50.730 --> 02:52.620
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.

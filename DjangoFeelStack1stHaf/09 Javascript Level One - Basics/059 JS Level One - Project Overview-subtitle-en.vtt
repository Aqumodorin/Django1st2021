00:05.050 --> 00:09.840
Hello everyone and welcome back to Part 9 javascript level 1 project.

00:09.940 --> 00:14.200
So we've completed all the normal lectures for dropped script level 1 and now it's time to actually

00:14.200 --> 00:16.140
do a project for this project.

00:16.150 --> 00:20.550
You'll be creating a simple web site that asks the visitor questions using javascript and the prompt

00:20.570 --> 00:22.480
function that we worked with earlier.

00:23.290 --> 00:27.280
However through all of these questions you're going to be secretly checking to see if there is a spy

00:27.280 --> 00:31.060
present and the spy is going to answer the questions in a very particular way.

00:32.260 --> 00:36.380
Behind the scenes are going to be using javascript to check for certain correct answers to questions.

00:36.520 --> 00:41.110
And if you find the spy do the correct answers you're going to leave them a secret message in the console

00:41.110 --> 00:42.000
for them to check.

00:42.910 --> 00:43.380
OK.

00:43.440 --> 00:48.790
You're going to be needing to check the part 9 underscore J s underscore project but a team file has

00:48.830 --> 00:51.330
the full instructions and the full correct answers.

00:51.360 --> 00:55.230
An example solution of the job secrets file is located under Part 9.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.110
Yes.

00:56.120 --> 00:59.820
So remember to link to your own dot script before getting started.

00:59.820 --> 01:03.230
So again you're only going to be editing a javascript file.

01:03.270 --> 01:06.110
You won't actually be touching any Timo.

01:06.270 --> 01:10.520
All right let's briefly explore the instruction page and see an example of what it should look like.

01:10.650 --> 01:14.230
After you're done with it and what hop over to the editor room browser now.

01:14.700 --> 01:21.020
OK here you have the actual HTML document open in my editor and also it links to the javascript filed

01:21.020 --> 01:24.360
a contains the solutions and this is what it looks like over here in the browser.

01:24.390 --> 01:30.130
So again just quickly to point out if you scroll all the way down on the part 9 javascript project body

01:30.150 --> 01:33.830
smell page right here under the script connection.

01:33.950 --> 01:37.460
It will connect to the solution script so it'll actually connect to part 9.

01:37.460 --> 01:41.970
But yes that's what you can connect it to if you want to see what an example solution looks like in

01:41.970 --> 01:42.810
your browser.

01:42.900 --> 01:47.130
But I recommend that once you're done dealing with that you change the source to your own javascript

01:47.130 --> 01:52.470
file so you can play around with working through the solution again everything you're doing is just

01:52.500 --> 01:53.560
in a javascript file.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.350
You won't actually be editing and he watched him for this.

01:56.370 --> 02:01.260
So let me show you what he actually asked him ilks like I've linked to here in my browser and going

02:01.260 --> 02:04.400
to zoom in a little bit so we can read it together.

02:04.440 --> 02:07.950
But here we have the welcome to part 9 your javascript level 1 project.

02:08.100 --> 02:12.210
And like I mentioned for this project you're going to be building a generic web site that just seems

02:12.210 --> 02:17.340
to ask some mundane questions that normal users but secretly you are looking for a spy and anyone visiting

02:17.340 --> 02:22.380
your web site is going to be asked a series of questions but only the spy is going to give you specific

02:22.380 --> 02:23.730
answers that you expect.

02:23.790 --> 02:28.050
And if all the questions are answered correctly you're going to post a secret message in the Council

02:28.050 --> 02:29.170
for the spy to read.

02:29.340 --> 02:32.740
So it's up to you what ever the secret messages be going to use cancel that log.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.530
If the answer the questions correctly.

02:34.650 --> 02:37.230
So here are the four conditions you're going to be checking for the spy.

02:37.560 --> 02:41.860
So the spy has the same first letter of her first name and her last name.

02:41.910 --> 02:47.850
So for example someone could be named Jose Johnson and J and J match.

02:47.850 --> 02:50.000
So that's the first letter and last letter.

02:50.070 --> 02:53.010
So that's a correct condition for the spy.

02:53.130 --> 02:57.660
The spy is also between the age of 20 and 30 exclusive of 20 at 30.

02:57.660 --> 03:00.810
So for example a 26 year old spy works.

03:01.050 --> 03:04.590
Then the spy is also at least 170 centimeters tall.

03:04.590 --> 03:07.070
Here we have 175 centimeters.

03:07.290 --> 03:09.670
And the spy has a pet name that ends with the letter Y.

03:09.930 --> 03:13.280
And in this case a pet name of Sammy would work.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.140
So you're going to ask the spy for their first name last name.

03:16.140 --> 03:17.000
What is their age.

03:17.020 --> 03:20.100
What is what is their height in centimeters and what is their pet name.

03:20.100 --> 03:24.060
And if the answer we think correctly according to these conditions so you're going to check these conditions

03:24.060 --> 03:26.430
using everything you learned about control flow.

03:26.580 --> 03:31.920
You will log a secret message to the consul and then they can inspect the page look at the consul and

03:31.920 --> 03:34.070
see if you left them anything.

03:34.080 --> 03:34.770
All right.

03:34.770 --> 03:40.170
So again we're just using javascript here and you can prompt for the information in any order you want

03:40.350 --> 03:44.240
and you can even do things like separate the first name prompt from the last name prompt.

03:44.250 --> 03:48.210
They'll probably make your life a little easier but all we're doing is just checking to see if these

03:48.240 --> 03:49.940
four conditions are true.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.660
This one this one this one and this one.

03:52.740 --> 03:55.980
So let's actually refresh this page and see what happens.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.510
Well this actually looks like we're going to refresh and it says Hello and welcome please and to your

04:00.510 --> 04:03.340
first name we'll say Jose.

04:03.670 --> 04:07.130
And your last name will see Johnson.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.310
How old are you.

04:08.330 --> 04:09.810
We'll say 26.

04:10.220 --> 04:13.930
We'll say we're 175 centimeters in the net.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.520
The name of our pet is Sammy.

04:15.540 --> 04:16.870
Oh OK.

04:16.950 --> 04:18.460
Thank you so much for the information.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.460
OK.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.460
And that's it it looks like nothing happened.

04:21.620 --> 04:29.450
But if I inspect and go to my counsel it says Welcome comrade you've passed us by test and exam and

04:29.450 --> 04:30.710
we are going to be doing.

04:30.900 --> 04:34.620
Let's refresh page and make sure that if I just put garbage.

04:34.620 --> 04:46.460
So let's say my name is Andy will I am 42 and 10 centimeters tall.

04:46.680 --> 04:51.720
My name or my pet is I don't know said OK.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.890
And it says sorry nothing to see here.

04:55.140 --> 04:55.430
OK.

04:55.490 --> 04:59.220
Hopefully you get an idea of what this project's actually getting at in the next lecture.

04:59.240 --> 05:02.370
I'll be coding out some solutions in the script file.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.230
Thanks everyone.

05:03.230 --> 05:04.240
Hope you enjoy the project.

05:04.250 --> 05:05.220
I'll see you at the next lecture.

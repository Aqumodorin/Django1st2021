Hello everyone and welcome back to part A.

00:07.660 --> 00:13.210
We're going to be going over the solutions to the loop exercise questions from the previous lecture.

00:13.360 --> 00:16.340
So let's continue going to open up my editor to get started.

00:16.570 --> 00:22.310
OK here we have the actual problems uploaded in the javascript with the comment that I had to follow.

00:22.540 --> 00:23.430
Now we're going to be doing.

00:23.430 --> 00:29.170
First is problem one where how do you use a for loop to Prince or console log out the word hello five

00:29.170 --> 00:31.950
times and we never actually did something quite like this.

00:31.960 --> 00:35.160
But hopefully you're able to figure it out with both methods.

00:35.170 --> 00:41.180
So if a while loop Let's show you how we can do that we'll see variable x is equal to zero.

00:42.070 --> 00:45.910
And you could have chosen any variable name here that the name doesn't actually matter.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.150
The say a while loop.

00:48.160 --> 00:54.750
Now I'll say while X is less than five I'm going to cancel that log.

00:55.760 --> 01:01.690
Hello and then I want to remember to add 1 to X and increment it.

01:01.880 --> 01:06.520
So now I run my code I see hello and it's been output 5 times.

01:06.540 --> 01:10.910
Google Chrome just lets you know that this little shortcut the bubble of Fibe there.

01:10.910 --> 01:14.950
Up next we have the for loop and I wanted to use a for loop to do this.

01:14.960 --> 01:17.930
So essentially you can just break down what we were doing up here above.

01:17.930 --> 01:20.930
So I have variable I's equal to zero.

01:21.170 --> 01:25.740
Since I is going to be less than five I put that here and I'll leave.

01:25.820 --> 01:26.900
Plus plus.

01:26.900 --> 01:32.790
And then I can actually just copy and paste the cancel command and just to make sure it's actually working.

01:32.810 --> 01:38.610
I'm going to say something like hello with for loop.

01:38.820 --> 01:40.080
We'll save that.

01:40.170 --> 01:43.640
Let's run this code and I see hello and then hello a for loop.

01:43.650 --> 01:45.350
The above ran five times.

01:45.380 --> 01:52.770
Great let's move on to Problem Two problem too just to use loops to cancel that log or print out all

01:52.770 --> 01:55.020
the odd numbers from 1 to 25.

01:55.140 --> 01:58.740
And we wanted to do this using two methods the while loop and then a for loop.

01:58.740 --> 02:00.590
Let's start off with the While loop.

02:00.720 --> 02:09.020
I'm going to make a variable called num and in the solutions actually just reassign them from a previous

02:09.020 --> 02:09.950
problem.

02:10.660 --> 02:26.770
And then I'm going to say while my num is less than 25 if numb maade to is not equal to zero.

02:26.790 --> 02:29.460
Remember previously if you want to check for an even number.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.460
We said Number two equals zero.

02:31.470 --> 02:34.140
In this case we're doing the exact opposite for our numbers.

02:34.260 --> 02:40.770
I'm going to log that NUM and then I also want to make sure that I continually add to them.

02:40.790 --> 02:41.850
So I'll just say no.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.350
Plus plus.

02:44.350 --> 02:47.880
So let's make sure that actually works and want to refresh my page here.

02:48.690 --> 02:54.270
And there are all the numbers one all the way to 23 for the while loop and now for the for loop.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.460
Let's do that as well.

02:58.030 --> 03:05.990
Ongoing same for and then I'm going to fix some of these so it says instead of the actual length of

03:05.990 --> 03:14.160
the array this is going to be five Let's expand this a little bit.

03:14.300 --> 03:24.270
So I'm going to say if I maade to is not equal to zero.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.070
Log.

03:28.060 --> 03:30.720
I that's really all there is to this.

03:30.720 --> 03:35.820
Make sure my brackets are balanced so I'll save that.

03:36.150 --> 03:38.130
And let's comment everything else out.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.560
So we make sure that only that is running.

03:40.710 --> 03:47.250
So I will save this scroll the way down refresh my page and here I only see one through three make sure

03:47.250 --> 03:48.510
it went all the way.

03:48.510 --> 03:50.110
That should have been 25.

03:50.220 --> 03:50.690
OK.

03:50.850 --> 03:52.310
Now is refresh page.

03:52.460 --> 03:54.600
And there we have it 1 through 23.

03:54.660 --> 03:55.330
Great.

03:55.350 --> 03:57.870
And that's how you could do it with a for loop.

03:57.930 --> 04:02.160
So that's it just to pretty simple problems and hopefully you can begin to see the relationship between

04:02.160 --> 04:03.990
the while loop and the for.

04:04.340 --> 04:04.860
OK.

04:05.130 --> 04:05.920
Thanks everybody.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.540
And in the next lecture we're going to get practice on everything we covered in javascript level 1 with

04:11.550 --> 04:13.580
a little bit of an assessment project.

04:13.580 --> 04:13.950
Thanks.

04:13.950 --> 04:15.090
And I'll see at the next lecture.

Hello everyone and welcome to part five control flow control flow is a fundamental aspect of any full

00:11.760 --> 00:17.680
programming language and it allows us to execute code only if a certain situation or condition arises

00:18.210 --> 00:23.880
and we can use it in combination of logical and comparison operators in case this is your first time

00:23.880 --> 00:29.170
programming we're going to briefly go over the main concepts of control flow such as if statements l

00:29.170 --> 00:32.490
statements and if statements in this lecture.

00:32.490 --> 00:36.720
If you've already programmed in another language before you may actually find that more useful just

00:36.720 --> 00:41.820
to reference the notes for this lecture to get the javascript syntax since a lot of these concepts are

00:41.820 --> 00:43.920
the same across programming languages.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.410
The only thing that's different is the actual syntax.

00:46.440 --> 00:50.070
So let's continue on and actually discuss control flow.

00:50.140 --> 00:52.000
So usually we have control flow.

00:52.060 --> 00:56.770
You're going to initiate some sort of condition check that returns a boolean which is either true or

00:56.770 --> 00:57.470
false.

00:57.580 --> 01:03.040
And then based off those results you use control flow to execute a specific block of code.

01:03.040 --> 01:06.440
Let's see the first basic example which is an if statement.

01:06.460 --> 01:08.920
So in this statement the general syntax looks like this.

01:09.070 --> 01:15.910
You say if and then some condition and that condition right there is usually some sort of comparison

01:15.910 --> 01:19.070
operator or you're checking for some sort of equality.

01:19.180 --> 01:24.730
So we say if this condition is true we execute some code that's inside those curly brackets.

01:24.730 --> 01:30.460
So the syntax is if imprint sees the condition check and then curly brackets you're going to execute

01:30.460 --> 01:32.610
some sort of code.

01:32.630 --> 01:34.370
Then there's the if else statement.

01:34.640 --> 01:41.240
And the main logic behind this is if some condition is true you execute some code that very first line

01:41.240 --> 01:46.730
there else meaning if that condition was not true you execute some other code.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.800
So here we're just checking if a condition is true.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.940
We execute some code.

01:50.150 --> 01:57.060
If it doesn't happen to be true than the else statement occurs and we execute some other code and then

01:57.060 --> 01:59.280
we have the if else if else statements.

01:59.280 --> 02:04.190
So if you want to check for multiple conditions not just one you can add an ELSE IF statement.

02:04.380 --> 02:05.680
So the syntax looks like this.

02:05.680 --> 02:11.550
We say if you check for some condition number one you execute some code then you can have an else if

02:11.550 --> 02:13.500
to check for another possible condition.

02:13.590 --> 02:17.720
And then you see some other code if condition want condition to.

02:17.750 --> 02:18.880
Don't bring up true.

02:19.050 --> 02:21.230
So neither of those conditions happened to be true.

02:21.240 --> 02:25.950
Then finally the else block executes some backup code OK.

02:26.070 --> 02:27.640
Let's actually code through some examples.

02:27.640 --> 02:32.910
I was just general syntax in a very high level overview but I think if we could through some examples

02:32.960 --> 02:34.400
I'll make it a lot clear.

02:34.410 --> 02:36.640
I'm going to open up my editor in my browser now.

02:36.810 --> 02:41.810
All right so here you have an html file open and javascript file open there both blank in my browser

02:41.820 --> 02:44.330
is connected right now to the h l file.

02:44.340 --> 02:49.420
So let's actually fill in the sage T.M. file and then also connected to the script.

02:49.740 --> 02:51.380
So I'm going to write scripts.

02:51.420 --> 02:57.770
I can get rid of that and just say the source is my script doc.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.070
Yes.

02:59.470 --> 02:59.930
OK.

02:59.970 --> 03:06.760
And let's make sure this is working by adding some sort of alert here that says hello.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.890
Save this I'll refresh my page and I get the alert.

03:10.920 --> 03:11.420
Hello.

03:11.610 --> 03:11.850
Great.

03:11.850 --> 03:13.980
So we're connected to the job script.

03:14.040 --> 03:18.870
That way if I want to run more than one line of javascript code all I have to do is type it to the database

03:18.870 --> 03:21.690
file and then refresh my browser over here.

03:21.900 --> 03:27.090
And let's actually open up the console here as well so I won't say inspect it the console and now I

03:27.090 --> 03:32.370
can see output so to begin seeing an if statement in action.

03:32.590 --> 03:36.010
We're going to start by creating two variables.

03:36.010 --> 03:43.110
First we'll create hot and we'll say it's false and then create another variable called Temp.

03:43.290 --> 03:51.920
And I will say it's equal to 60 and we're going to do it just apply some very simple logic code so we

03:51.920 --> 03:56.630
say if some condition is true then we execute code inside of those curly brackets.

03:56.630 --> 04:02.480
So for example we have these two variables hot contemp and imagine that hot starts off as false and

04:02.540 --> 04:05.100
temperature or temp is some number in degrees.

04:05.210 --> 04:09.380
And if the temp is greater than 80 we want to assign hot physical to true.

04:09.410 --> 04:13.550
So if it's more than 80 degrees I'm going to say that it hot is not true.

04:15.060 --> 04:16.310
So what does this look like.

04:16.440 --> 04:22.710
Well I can say if I could actually enter here and Adam will automatically fill in that sort of syntax

04:22.710 --> 04:23.710
scaffolding.

04:24.090 --> 04:26.850
And the most basic if statement is just if true.

04:27.270 --> 04:38.620
So let's run this one first and don't say if true I will log Iran refresh the page here and it says

04:38.680 --> 04:39.150
Iran.

04:39.160 --> 04:42.350
So that's the very most basic if statement if true.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.210
And then this always runs because it will always be true.

04:45.430 --> 04:48.890
Let's show you something a little more realistic using those two variables.

04:48.990 --> 05:00.970
I'll say if the temperature is greater than 80 logged temp is greater than 80.

05:01.030 --> 05:08.110
We'll save that refresher page and we actually don't get any output which makes sense because remember

05:08.110 --> 05:13.700
temperature is 60 but now let's do this.

05:13.840 --> 05:19.690
If temperature is greater than 80 I will say hot is equal to true.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.510
And the secondly the first time we show this.

05:21.520 --> 05:25.210
But this is how you can reassign a variable in Javascript.

05:25.210 --> 05:28.600
So right now I initiated it with the V.A. our call.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.550
So this is for initialising that variable.

05:30.550 --> 05:35.910
But if I just want to reassign it I have to make sure it's reassigned to the same data type here.

05:35.980 --> 05:37.020
So it's also a boolean.

05:37.030 --> 05:44.560
But in this case I'm reassigning it to true and then I'm going to log out.

05:44.630 --> 05:48.800
So let's see what happens if I refresh this page I get false.

05:48.800 --> 05:54.050
So what actually happened here will have my variable is equal to false temperature 60.

05:54.290 --> 05:57.930
I said if the temperature is greater than 80 re-assign hot to be true.

05:58.100 --> 06:03.110
And then finally output hot since temperature was not greater than 80.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.060
This re-assignment never occurred.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.850
Meaning hot is always going to stay false.

06:07.850 --> 06:12.950
Now let's try this again but set the temperature to be higher than 80 100.

06:13.080 --> 06:18.540
So take a moment and think what we'll see when actually refreshes page will it be false or true.

06:18.570 --> 06:20.850
To refresh and it's true.

06:20.870 --> 06:23.680
Which makes sense because the temperature is now 100.

06:23.720 --> 06:29.120
Meaning if the temperature is greater than 80 100 greater than 80 re-assign hot to be equal to true

06:29.500 --> 06:33.590
and then log whatever hot currently is and hot was reassigned to true.

06:33.590 --> 06:36.490
And that's the very basics of an IF statement.

06:36.500 --> 06:41.470
Now let's imagine that we want to execute another block that occurs if the if statement is false.

06:41.660 --> 06:46.130
Well in that case we can use an L statement to do this let's add that in.

06:46.330 --> 06:51.740
So I'm going to say just console log up here.

06:53.030 --> 06:57.160
Console log on outside.

06:57.160 --> 07:02.830
So if the temperature is greater than 80 I'm going to say it's hot outside else and you can see that

07:02.830 --> 07:08.160
Adams helped me out here so I'll just take to help else I will log.

07:09.810 --> 07:18.480
It's not very hot today and you might be wondering hey why doesn't else actually have this parentheses

07:18.480 --> 07:19.440
check here.

07:19.440 --> 07:23.850
And the reason is because else doesn't need to check for any specific condition.

07:23.910 --> 07:29.700
You remember else is going to occur only if all the conditions above it never were activated they were

07:29.700 --> 07:30.730
never true.

07:31.160 --> 07:31.830
OK.

07:32.070 --> 07:33.310
So let's try this again.

07:33.510 --> 07:39.650
I'm going to delete this line right here and I'm going to set temperature equal to 100.

07:39.660 --> 07:45.690
So let's think what's going to log if I set temperature equal to 100 or refreshed this page and it says

07:45.690 --> 07:46.430
it's hot outside.

07:46.440 --> 07:50.640
So that makes sense if the temperature is greater than 80 log it's hot outside.

07:50.640 --> 07:54.720
Now let's set the temperature to be 50 degrees.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.360
What do we think is going to happen when I refreshed.

07:56.360 --> 07:57.760
Page.

07:57.870 --> 07:59.050
It's not very hot today.

07:59.070 --> 08:05.880
That makes sense because this if statement was never triggered as true meaning this statement is going

08:05.880 --> 08:06.360
to occur.

08:06.390 --> 08:07.480
It's not very hot today.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.670
That's the basics of it.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.170
If else statement.

08:11.380 --> 08:15.490
OK so we saw how if statements work how if else statements work.

08:15.490 --> 08:18.460
Now let's see how else if statements work.

08:18.460 --> 08:23.980
So again if we want to check more conditions in just one single condition and its opposite we can add

08:24.040 --> 08:27.730
ELSE IF statements to check for multiple specific conditions.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.490
And the way it looks is like this and you can see that Adam text editor will actually help us out and

08:33.490 --> 08:38.710
we see else if all hit enter and it makes sense that there's Prince he's here now because I want to

08:38.710 --> 08:41.680
check if another certain condition is true.

08:41.680 --> 08:45.310
So let's actually check for multiple temperature changes.

08:45.310 --> 08:49.010
So right now if the temperature is greater than 80 degrees I say it's hot outside.

08:49.990 --> 08:53.170
Now let's imagine that it's just pretty average or nice outside.

08:53.200 --> 09:06.440
So the temperature is less than or equal to 80 and the temperature is greater than or equal to 50 degrees.

09:06.440 --> 09:15.630
So somewhere in between 50 and 80 I'll say average temp outside.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.400
Now let's check for another condition.

09:18.220 --> 09:19.870
Again we'll call it else if.

09:19.870 --> 09:32.630
And inside the Sprint CS I'll put in another condition something like temperature less than 50 and temperature

09:33.080 --> 09:44.670
greater than or equal to 32 degrees alog that it's pretty cold out.

09:44.760 --> 09:53.010
And then finally I'm going to one else statement and for the sell statement I'm going to say it is very

09:53.010 --> 09:53.960
cold out.

09:54.030 --> 09:59.460
And the reason for that is because I know the else statement is only going to occur if the temperature

09:59.460 --> 10:01.050
is not greater than 80.

10:01.050 --> 10:07.350
It's not in between 1850 and it's not in between 32 and 50 meaning statements only going to occur when

10:07.350 --> 10:09.950
the temperature is less than 32 degrees.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.510
So let's try this out and make sure we got everything right.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.280
Going to refresh my page here.

10:14.370 --> 10:16.800
Member are starting temperatures 50 degrees.

10:16.980 --> 10:23.120
So if I refresh this I would expect it to say average temp outside because we fall right here.

10:23.170 --> 10:28.720
Temperatures equal to 50 let's make average temp outside go again with something like 70 degrees.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.530
Save this refresh and there it is again.

10:31.530 --> 10:32.990
Average temperature outside.

10:33.150 --> 10:40.620
Let's make it say it's pretty cold out so I'll say it's 40 degrees outside refresh and it says it's

10:40.620 --> 10:41.620
pretty cold out.

10:41.950 --> 10:51.360
And let's make it something like 10 degrees by refresh this page then it says it is very cold out meaning

10:51.490 --> 10:54.330
none of these conditions were actually activated.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.540
So the statement was activated.

10:57.010 --> 11:01.480
OK let's do one final example of comparison operators.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.700
So I will delete all this.

11:04.910 --> 11:07.290
And let's start with kind of a store example.

11:07.340 --> 11:16.310
So make a variable called and set it equal to 10 flips variable called him set it to 10 and then I'll

11:16.310 --> 11:20.430
create another variable called cheese and said it's equal to 10

11:24.160 --> 11:26.500
and we'll discuss semi-colons later on.

11:26.500 --> 11:31.560
You don't actually need those there so don't worry about having semi-colons everywhere right now.

11:32.080 --> 11:38.740
But let's say we want to report back to headquarters what are ham and cheese sales where we run a little

11:38.740 --> 11:40.540
store that sells ham and cheese.

11:40.780 --> 11:48.660
So I'm going to make my variable report equal to a string that's just blank right now.

11:50.520 --> 11:57.460
And then I'll start off with my first statement and I will say if the sales of him is greater than 10

11:57.700 --> 12:08.160
greater than or equal to 10 and cheese is greater than or equal to 10 I'm going to say my report is

12:08.160 --> 12:14.700
equal to strong sales of both ham and cheese.

12:15.930 --> 12:20.660
Then let's have an ELSE IF statement and the statement is going to say.

12:20.700 --> 12:38.600
Else if ham is equal to zero and cheese is equal to zero My report is going to be equal to nothing sold.

12:39.500 --> 12:46.230
And let's keep things simple with an L statement and I will say report is equal to.

12:46.320 --> 12:55.970
We had some sales of items and you can keep adding elses statements for things like if you only sold

12:55.970 --> 12:59.640
ham or you only sold cheese that day what would it look like.

12:59.780 --> 13:06.770
But at the end of this outside of these statements I'm going to say log or cancel that log and I will

13:06.770 --> 13:08.040
log my report.

13:09.130 --> 13:11.540
So it's refreshing and see what we get.

13:11.560 --> 13:14.350
So it says Strong sales of both ham and cheese that makes sense.

13:14.350 --> 13:21.200
Ham and cheese are both 10 right now let's say Ham is one will refresh this page.

13:21.220 --> 13:24.230
We had some sales of items that make sense.

13:24.320 --> 13:29.430
Let's change it so that nothing was sold is equal to zero and cheeses equal to zero.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.570
Refresh our page and it says nothing sold.

13:32.740 --> 13:33.790
OK great.

13:33.790 --> 13:40.360
Hopefully now you have a general understanding of if statements if else statements and if statements

13:40.470 --> 13:41.650
in javascript.

13:41.860 --> 13:45.510
Coming up next we're going to begin discussing loops with the while loop.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.260
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

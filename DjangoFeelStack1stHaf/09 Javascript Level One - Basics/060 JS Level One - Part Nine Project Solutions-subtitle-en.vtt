00:04.820 --> 00:06.290
Hello everyone and welcome back.

00:06.410 --> 00:10.910
Hopefully already attempted the javascript level and project because in this lecture we'll be coding

00:10.910 --> 00:12.580
through an example solution for it.

00:12.770 --> 00:16.340
OK I'm excited so let's get started by hopping over to the editor.

00:16.340 --> 00:16.760
OK.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.990
So here we have my editor open.

00:18.990 --> 00:21.430
I've linked the html file to my own script.

00:21.650 --> 00:23.000
My script is right now empty.

00:23.060 --> 00:24.380
So nothing's going on.

00:24.380 --> 00:26.370
When I refresh the page.

00:26.390 --> 00:31.490
So let's expand or editor at everything we need and then we'll test it out with the actual web site

00:31.490 --> 00:32.090
page.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.090
So I'm going to zoom in just a little more so we can see everything clearly.

00:36.590 --> 00:36.870
OK.

00:36.890 --> 00:43.560
The first thing I need to do is have the four conditions that I'm going to be checking.

00:43.580 --> 00:45.420
Remember those four conditions are this.

00:45.460 --> 00:49.160
It's the name condition so I'm going to make variables for these.

00:49.740 --> 00:54.120
And the name condition will have that be NULL to start off with the name condition.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.690
Is this their first name.

00:55.700 --> 01:01.200
First letter of the first name matched the first letter of their last name and you can actually not

01:01.200 --> 01:05.690
have them be null they can be anything because we're going to be reassigning these later on but I'm

01:05.700 --> 01:08.470
going to make them null to be clear that they're nothing right now.

01:09.470 --> 01:15.850
And if you want we can put some icons there the conditions so they have to be between 20 and 30 exclusive.

01:15.870 --> 01:22.960
We also have the high condition that's going to be No.

01:23.460 --> 01:26.890
And then we also finally have the same condition.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.730
So I will say var that condition is nil.

01:32.840 --> 01:35.500
OK so those are the four conditions that I'm checking for.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.620
But remember I'm actually going to need to at least ask some questions.

01:38.680 --> 01:45.050
So let's put those questions at the top and going to grab the first name.

01:45.150 --> 01:47.510
It's going to be a prompt whoops.

01:47.610 --> 01:55.650
Now what I wanted it prompts and I will ask first name please.

01:55.750 --> 02:02.670
And you can basically write as much or as little as you want and then ask for the last name and I'm

02:02.670 --> 02:03.680
going to.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.640
Sorry about that.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.360
There it is prompt.

02:06.390 --> 02:07.450
OK.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.560
I'm going to ask for the last name please.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.960
And then the next variable i want is age.

02:15.240 --> 02:21.740
So I'm going to ask how old are you.

02:21.900 --> 02:22.450
Questionmark

02:25.130 --> 02:26.570
also on height.

02:26.930 --> 02:28.050
So that's another promt.

02:28.160 --> 02:31.460
So just a bunch of prompts so we ask the user when they reached a page.

02:31.670 --> 02:36.620
What is your Height's question mark.

02:36.730 --> 02:42.720
And then finally that name will ask for a prompt.

02:42.720 --> 02:45.620
What is your name questionmark.

02:45.630 --> 02:47.930
So we have everything after all of that.

02:47.940 --> 02:49.900
I'm just going to say it.

02:50.340 --> 02:54.380
Thank you so much for the information.

02:56.280 --> 03:01.910
And it doesn't matter a whole lot whether we define these four condition variables before or after this.

03:01.910 --> 03:07.930
But I like the idea of grabbing all the variables that we need from the user first and then having all

03:07.930 --> 03:09.440
our logic follow it.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.880
So we had those four conditions.

03:11.880 --> 03:16.740
Let's start using control flow to actually check that these conditions are true or false.

03:16.740 --> 03:21.960
So the first we need to check is the name condition remember the name.

03:21.960 --> 03:27.010
Condition asks is the first letter of their first name and the first letter of their last name.

03:27.090 --> 03:28.530
The same thing.

03:28.710 --> 03:44.890
So I'm going to say if first name index at zero is equal to last name index at zero set the name condition

03:46.100 --> 03:54.920
to be equal to true else the name condition is going to be equal to false.

03:54.930 --> 03:59.250
That's a quick and easy way we can check if their first letter of their first name matches the first

03:59.250 --> 04:01.170
letter of their last name.

04:01.170 --> 04:05.020
Now we want to check the age condition.

04:05.150 --> 04:05.900
So how do we do that.

04:05.900 --> 04:11.780
Well we want to say if age is greater than 20s or are we doing exclusive.

04:11.780 --> 04:21.600
So I don't put that equal sign and ages less than 30 so we make sure not to over shoot this.

04:21.750 --> 04:28.320
I will say that the age condition Zuko is a true else.

04:28.350 --> 04:30.740
I know they didn't pass the age test.

04:30.780 --> 04:33.570
Age condition is equal to false.

04:33.850 --> 04:37.920
And hopefully now you can see why we could have assigned something else for the age condition we could

04:37.920 --> 04:41.620
have assigned them all to be true or all to be false to begin with.

04:41.640 --> 04:45.270
Moving along we have our age we have the first name check.

04:45.330 --> 04:47.220
And now I want to check the height condition

04:51.200 --> 04:53.000
so I will say if

04:56.420 --> 05:06.050
it's is greater than or equal to 1 7 Remember it was at least 170 that I want my height condition.

05:06.050 --> 05:17.170
I can see helping us out here to be true and just like the last time I'll say else I condition is equal

05:17.170 --> 05:18.340
to false.

05:18.340 --> 05:20.850
Pretty simple and pretty straightforward so far.

05:21.040 --> 05:27.050
And then last but not least I want to make sure that the pet name is ending with Y.

05:27.070 --> 05:31.360
This was a little tricky because we haven't shown anything quite like this but hopefully you're able

05:31.360 --> 05:32.490
to figure it out.

05:32.530 --> 05:39.820
I'll see if the pet name and then somehow I want to grab the last letter of the pet names.

05:39.820 --> 05:41.540
How do we actually do that.

05:41.830 --> 05:45.470
Well we know how to grab the first letter which is just 0.

05:45.550 --> 05:50.290
But if I want to grab the last letter I'm going to have to take into account that pet names can be of

05:50.290 --> 05:56.700
different lengths and one way it can do that is by calling that name length.

05:57.130 --> 06:02.860
So we might think that this gives us the very last letter but remember indexing starts at zero which

06:02.860 --> 06:06.630
means I need to subtract one from this in order to make it work.

06:06.730 --> 06:11.730
So you can imagine that if I had the pet name just be the letter A.

06:12.070 --> 06:15.040
And I want to check the last letter of the string of a single letter.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.560
I'd have to check 0 right.

06:16.810 --> 06:22.530
So even if it has length of one I'd have to say one minus one to actually grab that last letter.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.810
So that's just a quick explanation of why I have to do the minus one here.

06:25.820 --> 06:29.620
That's because indexing starts at zero and if you don't believe me you can kind of check it out.

06:29.630 --> 06:37.590
Play it yourself and I want to make sure this is equal to why and if that's the case then I know the

06:37.770 --> 06:42.790
condition will be reassigned to true else.

06:42.960 --> 06:50.680
I'll say that condition is equal to false great so have the pet name there and now I just want to check

06:50.680 --> 06:52.380
if all four conditions are true.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.310
So check all conditions

07:01.090 --> 07:06.570
and what I'm going to do here say if the name condition is true.

07:07.480 --> 07:20.820
Hans the age condition is true and the condition is true and the condition is true.

07:20.850 --> 07:31.470
I'm going to log something like welcome's by else we can either not do anything or just say nothing

07:31.470 --> 07:33.390
to see here.

07:34.300 --> 07:39.530
And sometimes what confuses beginners is the fact that I'm just writing here the actual condition and

07:39.530 --> 07:45.840
not saying something like name condition equals true and A's condition equals true etc..

07:46.040 --> 07:51.020
Remember these are already booleans themselves so these conditions should already be booleans by the

07:51.020 --> 07:52.750
time they get to this stage.

07:52.760 --> 07:57.770
They're either all true or all false or some combination of true and false meaning I don't need actually

07:57.770 --> 07:58.210
check.

07:58.250 --> 07:58.900
Is Equal equal.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.150
True because they're actually all conditional tricks.

08:01.340 --> 08:06.560
So basically is going to be something like True and False and True and False or false false and false

08:06.560 --> 08:08.070
are true or untrue etc..

08:09.100 --> 08:13.330
Ok so you can always review the actual part 9 javascript if you want.

08:13.330 --> 08:18.790
The written code for everything not just that here let's say this and actually test it out to make sure

08:18.790 --> 08:21.920
it worked going to expand this.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.580
We are going to refresh

08:27.300 --> 08:29.320
and here we see first name please.

08:29.510 --> 08:36.080
All input Jose last name will say John how old mine will say we are 27.

08:36.080 --> 08:36.950
What is my height.

08:36.980 --> 08:38.910
I'll say 180 centimeters.

08:38.960 --> 08:39.720
Pet name.

08:39.860 --> 08:41.820
I'll say Franki for y.

08:42.020 --> 08:46.450
Thanks so much for the information we Right-Click inspect.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.820
Check the console and it says welcome by.

08:48.860 --> 08:50.450
Let's make sure the inverse is true.

08:50.470 --> 08:53.490
So I refresh this page first name.

08:53.490 --> 08:54.990
Just going insert some garbage.

08:54.990 --> 08:57.910
Last name some other garbage held in my amp.

08:57.930 --> 09:04.440
12 years old will say were 120 centimeters and pet name is Alph.

09:04.620 --> 09:08.880
Now it says nothing to see here Merfolk So it looks like our solution worked correctly.

09:08.950 --> 09:12.030
OK if you have any questions feel free to post them to the Kewney forums.

09:12.150 --> 09:13.860
But you are now complete with javascript.

09:13.860 --> 09:14.590
Level 1.

09:14.610 --> 09:17.130
It's time to move on to javascript level 2.

09:17.130 --> 09:19.330
Thanks and I'll see it the next section of the course.

Hello everyone and welcome back to part six objects exercise.

00:10.010 --> 00:16.010
So for this exercise check out the file Part 6 underscore objects underscore exercise that Jap's which

00:16.010 --> 00:19.850
is under the javascript level 2 folder it contains three objects.

00:19.850 --> 00:23.890
Along with tasks that involve you adding methods to each of these objects.

00:23.990 --> 00:26.310
Let's take a quick look at this file and what you have to do.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.020
OK so this is what the file looks like.

00:29.020 --> 00:32.810
It has three problems which have three basic objects.

00:32.860 --> 00:37.600
You get an object that looks like this for the first one and then we want you to add a method called

00:37.600 --> 00:43.200
name length that prints out the length of an employee's name to the consul.

00:43.430 --> 00:48.570
And then for problem to you're given the same object this employee object with the name job and age.

00:48.680 --> 00:53.390
And we want you to write a program that will create an alert in the browser of each of the objects values

00:53.390 --> 00:54.520
for the key value pairs.

00:54.520 --> 01:00.180
So for example it should ILIR name is John Smith job as programmer age is 31.

01:00.220 --> 01:05.750
So remember the use of this keyword in order to solve this and then back to Problem 3 the very last

01:05.750 --> 01:06.310
one.

01:06.440 --> 01:11.370
We just want you to add a method called last name that prints out the employee's last name to the council.

01:11.570 --> 01:17.690
And for this you got to do a little bit of research because notice the name comes as just a single string

01:17.960 --> 01:22.660
with a space in between and you're going to need to figure out how to split a string to an array.

01:22.820 --> 01:27.010
And there's a hint here linked to W3 schools where they show you how to do that.

01:27.320 --> 01:27.670
Right.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.850
Those are the three problems.

01:28.850 --> 01:29.900
Pretty simple.

01:29.900 --> 01:32.420
I'll see at the next lecture where we actually cut through the solutions.

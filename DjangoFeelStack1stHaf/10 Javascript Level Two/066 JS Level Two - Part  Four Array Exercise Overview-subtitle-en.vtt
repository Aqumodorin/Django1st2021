00:05.020 --> 00:09.600
Well everyone welcome back to part for a re exercise.

00:09.610 --> 00:13.530
It's now time to practice using arrays in a more realistic situation.

00:13.640 --> 00:20.500
And we're going creating a very simple student roster at using the javascript code that we know so far.

00:20.620 --> 00:27.640
Go ahead and check out for Array exercise se him I'll file open it up in your browser and read the instructions

00:27.640 --> 00:28.140
there.

00:28.360 --> 00:33.490
I'm going to hop over to my browser with that file open to explain the actual exercise.

00:33.490 --> 00:39.340
OK so I have here the h him l file for open in my browser and like I mentioned for this exercise we're

00:39.340 --> 00:44.890
making a very simple web app that contains an array of student names in a javascript file using an array

00:45.460 --> 00:51.450
and the Web site is going to prompt you for four possible commands Add Remove display and quit.

00:51.520 --> 00:56.440
So those are things that you're actually going to type in and this web page will prompt the user for

00:56.440 --> 00:57.700
one of those commands.

00:57.790 --> 01:00.370
And then here's what these commands should do so.

01:00.460 --> 01:04.400
And it will then create a prompt for a student name request.

01:04.420 --> 01:09.600
Then we add this name to the student to the array of the student names in the script file.

01:10.900 --> 01:14.050
Remove will create a prompt for a student named requests.

01:14.190 --> 01:20.520
Then remove this name from the roster array display will print out the roster using console log in quit

01:20.570 --> 01:22.660
will end the while loop of prompts.

01:22.740 --> 01:25.120
So let me actually show you what this would look like.

01:25.170 --> 01:29.770
I'm going to refresh this page and run through what this may actually look like.

01:30.560 --> 01:34.920
First off it asked me Would you like to start the roster webapp Y or N..

01:34.940 --> 01:36.430
Yes or no.

01:36.570 --> 01:38.530
I'll enter y.

01:38.540 --> 01:39.320
OK.

01:39.590 --> 01:47.020
And then it says Please select the action Add Remove display or quit point to add and what name would

01:47.020 --> 01:48.130
we like to add.

01:48.910 --> 01:53.210
And we're going to be worried about single word name so first names only.

01:53.260 --> 01:55.130
I would like that Jose.

01:55.540 --> 02:01.780
And then it says Please select an action add remove this player quit so I will say this play and if

02:01.780 --> 02:07.490
I hit OK I can see here in the Consul that I successfully added Jose incident roster.

02:07.840 --> 02:11.050
Now annoyed to add another name.

02:11.290 --> 02:17.710
Let's add Sam and Naledge display the roster again.

02:18.630 --> 02:22.650
I see now I have Jose and Sam in the array the consul.

02:22.800 --> 02:35.230
Now let's add one more name and I will add Franki books that he selects and action ad now it like that

02:35.240 --> 02:39.450
Frankie analogise display.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.600
I have Jose samen Frankie.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.500
Let's see what remove does.

02:44.610 --> 02:50.010
So it says Please select the action I type remove and then it says what name would you like to remove

02:50.190 --> 02:56.230
or remove my name Jose let's display aere.

02:56.600 --> 03:01.340
And here we see Sam and Frankie so I successfully removed Jose and then to end all this.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.410
I'll just quit and it says thank you for using the web app.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.840
Please refresh page start over.

03:06.860 --> 03:08.090
OK that's it.

03:09.080 --> 03:09.510
All right.

03:09.620 --> 03:15.440
So there is a javascript file that actually has a bunch of hints and comments.

03:15.450 --> 03:20.220
It's basically a walkthrough guide to help you out with this project going to take a look at it now.

03:20.330 --> 03:26.750
So the file you want to use and link to your east him file is called part for underscore array.

03:26.750 --> 03:29.090
Underscore exorcized javascript.

03:29.210 --> 03:32.400
This is a javascript file that just has a bunch of comments in it.

03:32.460 --> 03:33.620
Comments and hints.

03:33.650 --> 03:38.900
It's optional to use if you want you can go straight into the exercise without referencing this javascript

03:38.900 --> 03:39.950
file at all.

03:39.950 --> 03:45.830
But I would recommend that you check out the javascript file for the hints and the structure it provides.

03:45.830 --> 03:48.170
So again this is available to you.

03:48.170 --> 03:50.030
It basically tells you what to do.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.760
So for instance we've already created the roster for you.

03:52.760 --> 03:57.940
The variable roster and we want you to create functions for the tasks so add in use today.

03:58.190 --> 04:03.600
Create a function called add new that takes in a name uses that push to add a new students to the array.

04:03.770 --> 04:07.250
Then the remove student and we actually have hints here on stack overflow.

04:07.430 --> 04:13.880
We haven't shown you how to write a function called remove that takes in a name and then finds its index

04:13.880 --> 04:16.100
location that removes them from the roster.

04:16.190 --> 04:21.200
So there is a link here a stack overflow that will tell you how to remove a particular element from

04:21.200 --> 04:22.450
an array.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.030
Now we have the splay roster.

04:24.140 --> 04:27.770
Just create a function called display that prints up the roster con..

04:27.810 --> 04:32.570
That's pretty easy it's cons. that log basically and then start by asking if they want to use the web

04:32.570 --> 04:33.770
app yes or no.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.740
And now at the very bottom this is where all your logic is going to go.

04:36.740 --> 04:37.720
Create a while loop.

04:37.850 --> 04:39.120
It keeps asking for an action.

04:39.140 --> 04:44.090
Add Remove this player quit and then use if and else if statements to execute correct functions that

04:44.090 --> 04:47.360
we created above for each of those commands are right.

04:47.390 --> 04:49.020
You have any questions on this.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.670
Feel free to post the Kewney forums.

04:50.690 --> 04:55.760
You can always check out the javascript solutions if you get stuck on something or just hop straight

04:55.760 --> 04:56.990
to the next lecture.

04:57.050 --> 05:00.080
Run be coding through the solutions to this exercise.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.220
Thanks everyone and I'll see you in the next lecture.

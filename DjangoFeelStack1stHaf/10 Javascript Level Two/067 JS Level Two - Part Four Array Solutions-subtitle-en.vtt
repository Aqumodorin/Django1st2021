Hello everyone and welcome back to for Array exercise solution and in this lecture we're going to be

00:11.460 --> 00:16.170
coding through the solution for that student roster Auray exercise project.

00:16.170 --> 00:18.870
Let's head over to the editor and get started.

00:18.870 --> 00:24.130
OK so here with the javascript part for Array exercise file open.

00:24.180 --> 00:26.400
Let's start off by actually creating the functions.

00:26.400 --> 00:32.640
The first thing we need to create was the add new function for adding a new student so call the keyword

00:32.640 --> 00:40.320
function and we can just get it by typing F-you when hitting enter and we will say add new and add new

00:40.320 --> 00:42.200
will not take any parameters.

00:42.270 --> 00:49.100
Instead we're going to do is create a variable inside of add new called new name and we will prompt

00:49.100 --> 00:54.140
the user for what name would you like to add.

00:54.140 --> 00:59.570
Question mark and then once we get that new name we're going to push it to the roster.

00:59.840 --> 01:07.730
So we'll grab roster push and then push in that new name and that's all there really is for adding the

01:07.730 --> 01:08.820
new student.

01:09.050 --> 01:13.760
Now is talk about removing the student and this is actually quite a bit trickier and you definitely

01:13.760 --> 01:20.120
have to visit the stack overflow link if you're going to do it the same way I do it right now and that

01:20.200 --> 01:25.540
that overfilling basically has the answer of removing a particular element from an array.

01:25.550 --> 01:34.920
So again we'll create a function we'll call it remove and I'm going to say a variable we'll call it

01:34.920 --> 01:36.800
REM name for a move name.

01:38.760 --> 01:43.130
And we'll ask what name would you like to remove.

01:43.130 --> 01:52.360
Question mark and then I'm also going to create a variable called index and this is going to be roster

01:52.390 --> 01:56.800
dot and the method here is index of.

01:56.800 --> 02:05.670
And that was in the stack overflow link there so roster that index of REM name.

02:06.180 --> 02:11.820
And then the other thing from the stack overflow was the splice method and the splice method takes an

02:12.810 --> 02:15.390
index comma one

02:18.100 --> 02:20.590
where one is just how many elements who want to delete.

02:20.590 --> 02:21.100
Starting at.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.440
This index.

02:22.680 --> 02:25.030
And that's all there is for the remove function.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.940
Let's continue on with the next one.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.310
I actually want to do is display rosters.

02:30.310 --> 02:31.940
That was actually quite simple.

02:32.170 --> 02:34.990
It's basically just logging the roster.

02:35.050 --> 02:47.540
So we're going to say function display doesn't take any arguments but we will just log the actual roster.

02:47.580 --> 02:54.510
Now it's time for basically the hard part which is actual all actually programming all that logic and

02:54.590 --> 02:59.960
lines create a couple more lines here just so I can see everything clearly.

02:59.970 --> 03:04.610
We're going to start off by creating two variables called Start and star.

03:04.650 --> 03:05.870
It's just a prompt.

03:07.440 --> 03:16.370
That says Would you like to start the Ruster web at and will only accept why or.

03:16.380 --> 03:24.700
And so will tell the user wire and there and I will also create a variable called request that is equal

03:24.700 --> 03:29.240
to empty and we'll see a request for as in just the second.

03:29.390 --> 03:38.850
But basically it's going to be a string and I'm going to say if Star is equal to y meaning the user

03:38.850 --> 03:42.490
did want to start the Web at while

03:44.770 --> 03:47.590
request is not equal

03:50.340 --> 03:55.290
to quit I'm going to do the following.

03:55.390 --> 04:00.010
I'll ask for a new request by prompting them.

04:00.210 --> 04:11.610
Please select an action add or remove display or quit.

04:11.830 --> 04:17.420
And here is where I'm actually going to start testing for stuff all inside this while loop.

04:17.450 --> 04:22.890
So if the request was equal to add.

04:23.340 --> 04:31.610
Well in that case I'm going to call add new and add new has the prompt asking for the new name and pushing

04:31.610 --> 04:33.110
it to the roster.

04:33.140 --> 04:36.560
So all I have to do is call add new nothing else.

04:38.350 --> 04:40.930
LCF request

04:43.530 --> 04:44.950
is equal to display.

04:45.180 --> 04:46.340
That's quite easy too.

04:46.370 --> 04:49.030
I just call display

04:53.060 --> 04:55.250
and then LCF

04:57.970 --> 04:59.410
what say request

05:01.860 --> 05:04.070
is equal to remove.

05:04.500 --> 05:08.260
Well in that case I just call the remove function that I created earlier

05:12.900 --> 05:18.950
and if we scroll all the way down we can see the rest of these brackets to make sure they're all balanced.

05:19.450 --> 05:27.520
And I'm going to have an alert here that says Thanks for using the web at.

05:27.610 --> 05:31.500
Please refresh to start over.

05:31.730 --> 05:34.940
And as a quick note I don't have an else statement here.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.980
I technically don't really need one for this entire thing to work.

05:38.980 --> 05:42.110
And the reason for that is because they're all in the while loop here.

05:42.430 --> 05:44.310
But something it could do is say.

05:44.310 --> 05:45.440
Else.

05:45.790 --> 05:47.400
And then just have it be quick.

05:47.450 --> 05:54.070
So say request is equal to quit.

05:54.290 --> 06:01.430
And basically what this does is if request is not add remove the player quit.

06:01.460 --> 06:04.010
So maybe the person typed something wrong.

06:04.190 --> 06:05.680
It will automatically quit.

06:05.690 --> 06:11.560
So we probably also want to say an alert here not recognized

06:15.140 --> 06:26.010
we'll quit or we could just say not recognized and then comment this up and then we'll continually ask

06:26.010 --> 06:27.140
for the prompt here.

06:28.440 --> 06:28.740
All right.

06:28.740 --> 06:30.590
So that's really all you have to do.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.710
Let's actually run this and make sure it worked.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.930
We're going to open up my browser.

06:36.010 --> 06:36.310
OK.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.580
Here is my browser.

06:37.710 --> 06:40.620
I've refreshed the page says Would you like start the web app.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.230
I will say yes please select an action.

06:43.230 --> 06:46.110
Let's add something we'll add.

06:46.120 --> 06:49.310
Jose let's display to make sure it works.

06:49.350 --> 06:50.090
There is Jose.

06:50.110 --> 06:57.020
Let's add one more we'll add in Sammy display Jose and Sammy are there.

06:57.440 --> 07:04.390
Let's remove Sammy and Alex display again.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.020
There's Jose.

07:06.300 --> 07:11.280
And then let's try just typing some random and it says not recognize great.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.590
That's exactly what we wanted.

07:12.930 --> 07:19.680
And then we will quit and it says thinks reason the web please refresh to start over.

07:20.130 --> 07:20.780
OK.

07:21.000 --> 07:21.750
So that's it.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.590
Looks like everything works correctly.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.470
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

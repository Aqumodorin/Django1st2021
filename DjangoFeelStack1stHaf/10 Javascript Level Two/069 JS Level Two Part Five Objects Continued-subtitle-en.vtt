Hello everyone and welcome back to the continuation of five javascript objects.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.730
Let's continue by discussing object methods object methods are essentially functions that are inside

00:16.730 --> 00:18.400
of an object.

00:18.470 --> 00:23.750
For example imagine we have our car in full object in the previous lecture we have the make year and

00:23.750 --> 00:29.530
model and then we actually input a function there as the value for a key.

00:29.570 --> 00:35.690
So the key is car alert and the value there is an actual function call and the function call just says

00:35.780 --> 00:36.150
alert.

00:36.170 --> 00:44.510
We've got a car here and then we can actually call that method off of the car info object meaning we

00:44.510 --> 00:52.040
can actually call methods off objects and they essentially act those functions inside of an object.

00:52.040 --> 00:57.110
Now more realistically what you're going to want to do is use key value pairs from the object itself.

00:57.290 --> 01:00.940
And in that case you're going to need to use a special this keyword.

01:01.190 --> 01:05.930
And the this keyword can be confusing for beginners at first so don't worry if you don't immediately

01:05.930 --> 01:07.040
fully grasp it.

01:07.130 --> 01:13.490
We're going to be seeing it when we talk about Jake queery But again coming back to the previous example

01:13.760 --> 01:18.630
here my function doesn't actually use any information that pertains to the object.

01:18.740 --> 01:20.620
It doesn't use the make your model.

01:20.660 --> 01:23.870
It's just the function that gives a basic alert.

01:23.870 --> 01:28.730
But imagine I want to actually use some of those key value pairs from the object itself.

01:29.510 --> 01:34.360
Well the this keyword acts differently depending on the situation or a javascript object.

01:34.430 --> 01:36.380
This keyword is set to the object.

01:36.380 --> 01:37.470
The method is called on.

01:37.480 --> 01:43.320
Let me show you an example of what I mean by that imagine I have this very simple object where it just

01:43.320 --> 01:48.120
has one singular property and that is the number 37.

01:48.210 --> 01:54.570
If I wanted a function called Report property I should say a method called Report Propp inside of my

01:54.570 --> 02:03.210
object that I call report Propp function and it returns this stop Propp where this is acting as a reference

02:03.210 --> 02:05.300
to the actual object.

02:05.310 --> 02:07.700
And then if I were to say something like cancel the log.

02:07.920 --> 02:15.820
My object that report Propp with the Call it would log seven into the console screen.

02:15.830 --> 02:16.250
All right.

02:16.370 --> 02:19.430
Here's a really good link for more details on the this keyword.

02:19.430 --> 02:23.030
Again it behaves differently in different situations and we're only really concerned about it right

02:23.030 --> 02:27.080
now as it behaves in an object in reference to methods.

02:27.290 --> 02:32.030
So let's cut out a few more examples of object methods to get a better grasp on everything that I just

02:32.090 --> 02:35.560
briefly mentioned moins hop over to the console now.

02:35.560 --> 02:35.780
All right.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.880
Here I am at the actual console.

02:37.880 --> 02:44.870
Let's create a very simple object we'll call it the variable simple and it's going to be an object with

02:45.680 --> 02:56.890
a property we'll call it Propp and that property is Will say hello and then it's going to have a method

02:56.920 --> 03:03.180
inside of it and we'll call this method my method just to make it very clear.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.080
Everything that's going on here.

03:05.300 --> 03:12.230
And then I use the function keyword close parentheses so it doesn't actually have any parameters there.

03:13.310 --> 03:16.780
And then I'm going to say Alert.

03:16.940 --> 03:28.810
Actually it's make this a console that log and it's going to console log the my method was called

03:32.540 --> 03:35.500
and then let's close off these parentheses here.

03:35.820 --> 03:37.960
So there is simple.

03:38.050 --> 03:41.800
So again simple as an object and no to actually show simple.

03:41.800 --> 03:47.920
It doesn't display the methods It just displays objects with the single property that key value pair

03:47.920 --> 03:48.830
Propp hello.

03:49.150 --> 03:57.210
If I say console Diyar an impasse and simple there I see an object that I can continue to expand to

03:57.210 --> 04:03.240
see my method and that property again you could have also continue to expand appear but that's just

04:03.240 --> 04:05.530
a simple note depending on what browser are you using.

04:05.550 --> 04:08.490
You may find it easier to say console dot the.

04:08.820 --> 04:12.400
Anyways back to actually learning how to use this method.

04:12.630 --> 04:19.860
I want to call the method I just say simple dot and then call my method and if I call my method here

04:19.860 --> 04:24.320
without any close parentheses and enter then it just reports back.

04:24.330 --> 04:29.490
The actual method inside of the object just like when we're calling functions we need to actually have

04:29.490 --> 04:32.080
an open set in close parentheses on it.

04:32.980 --> 04:38.650
That way I can execute the function which means I will call that my method close parentheses.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.170
And here it says the.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.240
My method was called Perfect.

04:42.250 --> 04:44.400
That's exactly what we expected.

04:44.410 --> 04:47.230
So again just to review here you have the property.

04:47.230 --> 04:49.140
There it is with the key value of prayer.

04:49.180 --> 04:50.670
And here you have my method.

04:50.860 --> 04:55.890
We do a function call and then inside these clearly brackets whatever we want to actually execute whenever

04:55.880 --> 04:59.620
we call that method off of this function.

04:59.650 --> 05:07.120
Now let's see how we can use actual properties that are already in the object inside of my method.

05:07.120 --> 05:12.280
So I'm going to clear this all right so to show the use of the this keyword are going to create a new

05:12.280 --> 05:20.740
variable and we'll call it my Obie J for my object and I will set it equal to an object.

05:20.860 --> 05:28.160
The object is going to just have one property will say it's the name and the name is going to be Jose

05:28.160 --> 05:34.310
or you can just fill in whatever name you want there and then let's actually give it a method and we'll

05:34.310 --> 05:39.880
call this method great where we actually greet who's ever name isn't my object here.

05:40.220 --> 05:48.520
So I have three and I'm going to call the function keyword curly brackets and then here I'm going to

05:48.520 --> 06:00.850
say console log and I want to say hello and then concatenate the name in my object and the way I do

06:00.850 --> 06:09.760
this is by using the this keyword I call this dot and then I actually pass in whatever property I want

06:09.790 --> 06:14.610
the key to that value pair and in that case it's going to be name.

06:14.630 --> 06:21.980
So I say this name and refers to the current object thymine whatever property that is and that's how

06:21.980 --> 06:29.000
we can actually create a method that uses properties of the object we are currently in.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.890
So when you do now is actually close off and balance off these brackets here.

06:36.070 --> 06:38.300
Let's make sure that works when we hit enter there.

06:38.390 --> 06:39.640
Okay perfect.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.830
And then I'm going to call my object.

06:42.880 --> 06:50.960
It's an object with a name I want to see that name I could also just say name Jose.

06:51.140 --> 06:53.600
And now let's check to see if it actually worked.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.050
When I call.

06:55.810 --> 06:59.180
So called greets and remember just like a function.

06:59.270 --> 07:03.460
If I don't have open and close parentheses here enter nothing sinister.

07:03.530 --> 07:07.400
So I need to open and close the Sprint see actually execute this.

07:07.550 --> 07:09.230
And it says Hello Jose.

07:09.230 --> 07:11.720
So I forgot to put a little space after hello.

07:11.720 --> 07:14.820
So let's fix that and come back up here.

07:15.110 --> 07:16.250
There's my object.

07:16.310 --> 07:23.100
Let's fix that by putting a space in there and let's call my object again.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.790
And then I say Hello Jose.

07:27.150 --> 07:27.540
OK.

07:27.600 --> 07:32.100
And that's really the basics of object methods as far as we need to know them.

07:32.220 --> 07:39.120
Again the main thing to get out here is that an object method is simply just like a function call inside

07:39.240 --> 07:40.900
of a key value pair.

07:41.070 --> 07:44.720
And if you want to use the properties of the current object you're in.

07:44.880 --> 07:51.270
All you have to do is use the this keyword and syntax highlighting will show you that it's a keyword

07:51.580 --> 07:55.580
and then you say dots and then whatever the property name you want to use it.

07:56.010 --> 08:01.200
OK so hopefully you have a better understanding now of how objects actually work in javascript how to

08:01.200 --> 08:03.840
create methods inside of an object and how to use that.

08:03.830 --> 08:06.730
This keyword coming up next is an exercise.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.690
Everything we learned about javascript objects.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.600
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

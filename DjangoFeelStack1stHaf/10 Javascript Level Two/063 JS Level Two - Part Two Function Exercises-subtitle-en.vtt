Hello everyone and welcome to part two function exercises.

00:09.530 --> 00:11.540
Let's get some practice of functions.

00:11.680 --> 00:17.000
But I want you to do is open up the file part to underscore functions underscore exercises that jazz

00:17.300 --> 00:22.790
which is located under the javascript level 2 folder the problems will gradually get harder as you go

00:22.790 --> 00:23.570
along.

00:23.570 --> 00:27.690
Let's take a quick look at this file and look at the problems.

00:27.770 --> 00:31.430
OK so this is what the exercise thought Jap's file looks like.

00:31.430 --> 00:35.860
And a lot of these problem statements are sourced from coding that dot com which is a great Web site

00:35.860 --> 00:36.960
for practice problems.

00:36.970 --> 00:42.480
You want to get more than what's here in this file but basically you're going to have a problem.

00:42.550 --> 00:48.010
The name of the problem and it's going to ask you to write a function to take in particular parameters

00:48.040 --> 00:49.590
and then give an output.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.500
And after the problem statement you'll see an example of what it should look like.

00:53.500 --> 00:57.230
So here we can see the sleep and function when it takes an false and false.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.970
It should output true.

00:59.130 --> 01:04.120
And if we keep going down we see something like monkey trouble if monkey trouble function takes and

01:04.120 --> 01:06.960
true and true it should output true center.

01:07.180 --> 01:12.710
We go down to string times and it says given a string and some integer do something with it.

01:12.790 --> 01:19.360
So string times we see it takes in a string a number and then outputs that string multiplied as many

01:19.360 --> 01:21.100
times as the number shows here.

01:21.960 --> 01:27.420
Then we see lucky some Which is another problem takes in three numbers a certain number of the penny

01:27.420 --> 01:28.840
and what's going on.

01:29.040 --> 01:33.680
And then finally we have problem five which is a speed ticket problem.

01:33.810 --> 01:38.790
You get a number and a boolean value and you either get 0 or 1 or 2.

01:39.150 --> 01:43.300
So if we go all the way down we get this bonus problem which is make bricks.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.250
This is a pretty tricky problem.

01:45.270 --> 01:48.330
So if you can't figure this one out don't worry that's why it's a bonus.

01:48.330 --> 01:50.570
Go ahead and read the problem see if you can figure it out.

01:50.580 --> 01:56.310
But this has to do not so much with javascript but more of just computer science and trying to think

01:56.310 --> 01:57.630
like a programmer.

01:57.630 --> 01:57.960
OK.

01:58.020 --> 01:59.920
So leave that one is a bonus for you.

01:59.970 --> 02:04.000
Go ahead and tackle the other five and I will see you in the next lecture.

02:04.010 --> 02:06.180
We're going to be programming through the solutions.

02:06.390 --> 02:07.350
Thanks everyone.

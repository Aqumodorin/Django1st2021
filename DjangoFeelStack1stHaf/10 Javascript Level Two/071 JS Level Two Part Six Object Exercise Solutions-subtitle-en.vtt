00:04.520 --> 00:08.960
Well everyone welcome back to Part 6 ogic exercise solutions.

00:08.980 --> 00:12.880
We're going to be cutting through the solutions for the previous exercises.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.400
Let's hop over and get started.

00:16.400 --> 00:16.920
OK.

00:17.090 --> 00:25.250
For the first problem we had to do was actually console log the length of this name so how can we do

00:25.250 --> 00:25.580
that.

00:25.610 --> 00:32.780
Well first we need to create a method called the method name lines and then when I'm going to do is

00:32.780 --> 00:40.440
call the function and then have the set of curly brackets here and I will console log.

00:40.680 --> 00:50.230
And then I'm going to say this guy name that link and we didn't see an exact example of this of calling

00:50.350 --> 00:55.520
another property off the initial key value pair property the Hopefully are able to figure this out.

00:55.660 --> 00:59.760
So again this refers back to employee or current object.

00:59.770 --> 01:02.850
Do we have a name which is this property right here.

01:03.040 --> 01:07.690
And then I want to grab the link to that name which I say with that length and that's how you grab the

01:07.690 --> 01:10.410
length off of this name.

01:10.420 --> 01:16.560
Let's go down to Problem number two and Problem number two we wanted to write a program that will create

01:16.560 --> 01:21.780
an alert in the browser of each of the object values and the key value pairs.

01:21.780 --> 01:23.780
So for example it should alert.

01:23.820 --> 01:29.370
My name is John Smith job as programmer age is 31.

01:29.510 --> 01:41.300
So I'll call this method report we call the function won't have a name and then I say alerts and I'm

01:41.300 --> 01:48.600
going to say name is in loans concatenate everything we need we want this done name.

01:48.910 --> 02:01.970
And then I also want to concatenate Khama job is and then I want to say this job and then I'm going

02:01.970 --> 02:12.350
to concatenate with comma ages and then concatenate that with this dot age and that's all you had to

02:12.350 --> 02:13.130
do for this one.

02:13.130 --> 02:15.020
It's basically a bunch of this calls.

02:15.020 --> 02:20.360
So again this employee and then grabbed the actual properties name job and age and concatenate that

02:20.420 --> 02:22.730
all into a single alert call.

02:23.270 --> 02:23.860
All right.

02:24.020 --> 02:25.280
Finally the last problem.

02:25.310 --> 02:30.930
Problem number three which was add a method called last name that prints out the employee's last name

02:30.970 --> 02:32.120
the con..

02:32.210 --> 02:36.500
This is a little bit trickier because you had to figure out how to split a string to an array in order

02:36.500 --> 02:38.940
to just grab this right here.

02:39.380 --> 02:40.930
Let's show you how we can do that.

02:41.020 --> 02:49.740
You were able to figure it out or create a method called last name type in function and then going to

02:49.740 --> 02:58.360
do is say cancel the log and I will grab this name and we had to do was you had to figure out you can

02:58.360 --> 03:06.220
call that split on a string and then as a parameter to that split method you can passen whatever you

03:06.220 --> 03:07.040
want to split on.

03:07.090 --> 03:12.370
And I want to split on a blank space here between the first and last name and then after that that returns

03:12.370 --> 03:13.110
an array.

03:13.320 --> 03:17.440
So index for the second item in the array which is the last name.

03:17.530 --> 03:22.270
Index 1 and that's how you can create a method that prints out the employee's last name.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.390
So again just to quickly review this one.

03:24.640 --> 03:30.580
This becomes the actual object we're in right now called the Data named property and that's the string

03:30.590 --> 03:32.060
John Smith.

03:32.140 --> 03:37.780
I'm going to take John Smith and then call split and I pass in an empty string here.

03:37.780 --> 03:43.450
Well it's not empty space there because I want to split on the space and that returns an array of two

03:43.450 --> 03:43.870
items.

03:43.870 --> 03:48.940
The first name and the last name John and Smith and I want to grab the second item index one which is

03:48.940 --> 03:50.610
Smith and that's the last name.

03:50.990 --> 03:52.930
OK hopefully you enjoyed those.

03:52.930 --> 03:56.620
And you were able to figure them all out if you had a little bit of trouble with them.

03:56.620 --> 03:57.660
Don't worry about it too much.

03:57.670 --> 04:00.820
We'll get more practice later on the course.

04:00.820 --> 04:02.850
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next section.

WEBVTT

00:05.080 --> 00:08.380
Hello everyone and welcome back to how the web works.

00:08.650 --> 00:11.640
And this lecture actually going to be discussing the following ideas.

00:11.650 --> 00:16.780
We'll talk about how the web works what is actually happening when you put a pro into your browser and

00:16.780 --> 00:21.430
how it connects and retrieves the Web site that will also talk about what we mean when we say full stack

00:21.430 --> 00:23.000
and full stack web development.

00:23.080 --> 00:28.480
We'll get a brief overview of the Course technologies that we teach here and also why we chose Shingo

00:28.480 --> 00:29.530
for the course.

00:29.560 --> 00:30.440
Let's get started.

00:31.320 --> 00:35.400
So before we can begin to learn about all the technologies in this course we need to understand how

00:35.400 --> 00:38.380
the web works and what actually constitutes the full stack.

00:39.340 --> 00:43.380
So what actually happens when you're at home and you open up your browser and visit web site.

00:43.540 --> 00:48.650
Let's break down the basic steps you start off by typing your your L into your browser.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.440
So you're home.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.350
You open up your browser and you type in whatever web site you want.

00:52.410 --> 01:00.290
Facebook com google.com etc. then your computer sends this request as a packet which includes the IP

01:00.290 --> 01:06.300
address of the Web site you want the IP address allows servers later on to actually identify what Web

01:06.300 --> 01:07.520
site you're looking for.

01:08.710 --> 01:14.260
And it sends requests through wires or a satellite which eventually links to wires using your internet

01:14.260 --> 01:15.510
service provider.

01:15.520 --> 01:20.740
So if you're at home your request is eventually sent through either copper wires or optic fiber wires

01:21.010 --> 01:25.330
to the server that we're about to reach or if you're on your cell phone it links to a satellite which

01:25.330 --> 01:29.690
links back down to earth which then ended up going to some sort of physical wire.

01:29.950 --> 01:35.050
And at a very very basic level the Internet is basically just wires connecting computers with some sort

01:35.050 --> 01:37.060
of protocol.

01:37.190 --> 01:42.860
So your ISP will then reroute the request the appropriate server location using the IP address as the

01:42.860 --> 01:44.500
guide.

01:44.630 --> 01:50.690
And then once your request reaches the server it can send back the Web site you asking for However a

01:50.690 --> 01:55.220
full web site of content is too big to send back as a single packet of data.

01:56.240 --> 02:01.880
And the way we solve this is the server sends back the Web site split up into many many packets and

02:01.880 --> 02:06.860
the packets come with instructions on how to get back to you and reassemble themselves once they reach

02:06.860 --> 02:07.280
you.

02:08.510 --> 02:12.320
And the packets though actually care how they get to you just the final location.

02:12.320 --> 02:17.390
So all these packets may take different paths to actually get to your computer or back to your cell

02:17.390 --> 02:19.230
phone or whatever browser you are using.

02:19.250 --> 02:24.430
What they really care about is the fastest way to get back to your destination at your home IP address

02:25.750 --> 02:30.130
and then once the packets reach you they're reassembled to show whatever page you were looking for.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.900
All of this moves at close the speed of light.

02:33.910 --> 02:35.450
So it happens very fast.

02:37.030 --> 02:39.090
OK that was a really high level explanation.

02:39.100 --> 02:42.190
But for our purposes it's really all we need to know for now.

02:42.190 --> 02:46.980
Let's continue on by discussing what we mean by the term full stack.

02:47.060 --> 02:48.980
There are two main components of a Web site.

02:48.980 --> 02:54.900
There's the front end of a Web site in the back end of a Web site the front end of a web site is what

02:54.900 --> 03:00.090
you see as a user on the Web site and then the back end is the technology used to actually decide what

03:00.090 --> 03:01.940
to show you on the front end.

03:01.950 --> 03:04.880
For instance let's say you're looking at Facebook dot com.

03:05.160 --> 03:11.490
So what you see the colors the actual content there that's all the front and stuff the back end is what

03:11.490 --> 03:17.700
the sides if you're a user coming in what pictures or content or comments to retrieve from the database

03:18.000 --> 03:23.430
and then show it to you on the front and so let's talk a little bit more about that front and the front

03:23.430 --> 03:26.250
end really revolves around three key technologies.

03:26.600 --> 03:30.340
L CSSA and Javascript.

03:30.370 --> 03:34.810
You will hear about the front end technologies such as Jake queery and bootstrap which we also cover

03:34.810 --> 03:40.870
in this course but those are actually all things built using those previous three H.M.S. SS and Javascript.

03:40.930 --> 03:46.500
Those are really the three core front end technologies that basically every modern web site uses today.

03:47.890 --> 03:52.310
H.T. email is hypertext markup language and every Web site will have HTL.

03:52.320 --> 03:57.540
Its the structure of the page and you can actually view it by right clicking and selecting new page

03:57.540 --> 03:57.970
source.

03:57.990 --> 04:02.610
If you're using the Chrome browser on any Web site so you can open up your browser on this page right

04:02.610 --> 04:06.080
click select View page source and you'll actually see the page Tim L..

04:06.120 --> 04:11.450
For whatever web site you're looking at then there's CSSA which is cascading style sheets.

04:11.480 --> 04:18.110
And C Ss is the actual styling of the Web site colors fonts borders etc. it's all defined by CSX.

04:18.110 --> 04:24.080
And C Ss is not mandatory but almost all sites have it in order to make the Web site look good.

04:24.250 --> 04:29.190
And then finally javascript allows you to add interactivity to the Web site including programming logic

04:29.540 --> 04:32.390
and he said if interactivity uses Javascript in some way.

04:32.590 --> 04:35.980
Otherwise if the site doesn't actually do anything it just displays information.

04:36.070 --> 04:38.120
The site is known as a static web site.

04:39.740 --> 04:44.560
OK so the first half of this course is going to focus on the front end and the front end in some way

04:44.570 --> 04:47.300
it's always going to use those three technologies.

04:47.330 --> 04:54.500
However it's the back end where a multitude of options come up so the back end of a site has three components.

04:54.520 --> 04:59.590
The language you choose for the back and the framework you choose for that language and the database

04:59.620 --> 05:03.940
you want to connect to technologies such as ph P..

05:03.960 --> 05:09.170
No it's Ruby on Rails Java pythonic cetera are all viable options for a web site.

05:09.240 --> 05:16.680
So how do we actually decide which option to choose will our course Bakan uses the python as the language

05:17.040 --> 05:19.670
Django as a framework for Python and then sequel.

05:19.740 --> 05:23.310
As the database Python is a great language to learn.

05:23.460 --> 05:27.830
It's simple powerful and already has many libraries for it.

05:27.930 --> 05:29.430
So what does that actually mean.

05:29.430 --> 05:35.970
Well it's simple because the actual syntax of programming through python is based on code readability

05:36.000 --> 05:36.890
and clarity.

05:37.070 --> 05:41.730
Meaning you're going to save yourself a lot of time programming because of how easy Python is to learn

05:42.150 --> 05:43.340
and type with.

05:43.520 --> 05:48.130
And then it's powerful and scalable and it also has many libraries already attached to it.

05:48.180 --> 05:52.680
So if you're interested in an application such as machine learning for your web site data visualization

05:52.680 --> 05:55.530
free web site or even things such as gaming for your web site.

05:55.530 --> 06:00.660
Python already has many libraries you can use to implement those ideas into your project.

06:00.660 --> 06:04.400
And Django is the most powerful and popular framework for Python.

06:04.530 --> 06:11.220
It's fast secure and scalable and it's used by many actual web sites such as Pinterest Instagram bitbucket

06:11.280 --> 06:17.310
they all run on Django and then sequel light comes of jinglin Python making it a very easy choice to

06:17.310 --> 06:18.890
use as our database.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.580
As we continue along the course we're going to be discussing each of these topics in much more detail

06:23.790 --> 06:27.630
but for now you should have a high level view of what we use in this course to turn you into a full

06:27.630 --> 06:30.910
stack web developer with Shingo full stack meaning.

06:30.930 --> 06:36.330
We combined the front end technologies with the backend technologies so you can create a Web site all

06:36.330 --> 06:38.010
the way through from scratch.

06:38.330 --> 06:43.340
Ok now that we have the high level overview Let's go ahead and get started with the rest of the course.

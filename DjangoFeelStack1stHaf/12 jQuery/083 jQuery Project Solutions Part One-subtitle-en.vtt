Hello everyone and welcome back to the solution lecture part one for the front and PROJECT.

00:10.070 --> 00:13.280
We're going to be cutting through the solution for the connect for game.

00:13.420 --> 00:15.730
Let's get started by hopping over to our editor.

00:15.910 --> 00:16.300
OK.

00:16.330 --> 00:22.630
So to get this project started I have three files in HTL file a CSSA file and a javascript's File.

00:22.630 --> 00:25.990
We're going to start off with the HTL then we'll Stylo some CSSA.

00:26.110 --> 00:29.950
And then finally the majority of our time is going to be spent coding through the logic we have.

00:29.940 --> 00:32.020
Jake Query and Javascript.

00:32.020 --> 00:33.460
Let's get started with the HMO.

00:33.580 --> 00:36.120
So the smell is actually quite straightforward.

00:36.130 --> 00:38.660
First we just do the basic aist him all call.

00:38.980 --> 00:42.300
We can give it the title K'NEX for save that.

00:42.490 --> 00:48.920
And then I want to link to bootstrap as well as my own CSSA file.

00:48.950 --> 00:56.480
So let's start with my C Ss which is I have it just being called game that C Ss let me save that and

00:56.480 --> 01:02.390
I'm going to copy and paste the Cdn link for bootstrap and you can just copy and paste this yourself

01:02.420 --> 01:07.030
either from the notes or from Boots get bootstrap dot com.

01:07.070 --> 01:13.610
So there's a C and for bootstrap lets make sure everything's working just by saying hello in the heading

01:13.610 --> 01:15.620
and refreshing our age Tim Page.

01:15.830 --> 01:19.260
OK it looks like it's connected networking.

01:19.280 --> 01:25.190
Let's start by putting everything into a div container so that we keep it organized and centered on

01:25.190 --> 01:26.070
the page.

01:26.910 --> 01:34.880
And I will make sure that it's completely aligned centered by saying a line center as a parameter in

01:34.880 --> 01:50.080
that div and all have one say welcome to Connect for all have heading to say something like connect

01:50.080 --> 01:56.100
4 chips to win and then H-3 will say

01:59.000 --> 02:04.190
let's start or want to delete this refresh.

02:04.270 --> 02:05.470
Make sure everything is working.

02:05.470 --> 02:07.710
Looks like it's good.

02:07.880 --> 02:13.740
Now the task we have to accomplish is actually constructing the table that's going to be connect 4.

02:13.770 --> 02:17.450
So what I am going to do and you don't have to do it this way there's many ways you can bill at this

02:17.450 --> 02:22.810
table to create a table row with each table cell.

02:22.870 --> 02:27.580
What's containing a button inside of it.

02:29.620 --> 02:34.620
And then something else going to do is make sure I call table here.

02:34.630 --> 02:43.590
Let's put this row back and say that table and then let's give this table a class equal to board so

02:43.590 --> 02:44.950
we can reference it later.

02:45.030 --> 02:50.770
Although this will be just the only table tagging RHC mail we could just use the table tags or reference

02:50.760 --> 02:54.540
it later on who will give it a class so it makes a little more sense.

02:54.540 --> 02:56.120
And then finally type button.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.990
We don't need a name for this button.

02:58.650 --> 03:00.550
And the button itself can be blank.

03:00.610 --> 03:05.280
So the idea is we're going to be clicking buttons on and off we'll have them change color to depict

03:05.350 --> 03:08.250
whether the chip is inside of that area or not.

03:09.220 --> 03:17.790
And we need to add a couple more cells to this row so we can just copy and paste this.

03:17.790 --> 03:18.720
There we go.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.650
So let's save that.

03:20.730 --> 03:23.290
It's going to be seven cells per row.

03:23.670 --> 03:32.370
And then I can just copy and paste this row and then continue on and connect four has six total rows.

03:32.490 --> 03:34.910
So I need to do this five more times.

03:37.010 --> 03:43.570
Let's make sure that's one row to row three row for row five row six row I believe.

03:43.890 --> 03:49.400
But let's actually make sure of this by refreshing our page here I can see a little table it's kind

03:49.400 --> 03:54.470
of messed up and that's because it's actually not inside of our container class.

03:54.470 --> 03:58.270
Let's bring this div all the way down here.

03:59.260 --> 04:01.510
Save this refresh.

04:01.780 --> 04:10.200
Now I can see I have a seven cell across and the rows and six rows total grape.

04:10.200 --> 04:19.270
Finally I want to T.M. connect my script so I'm going to call scripts and I will connect this to the

04:19.290 --> 04:21.810
can say source.

04:21.860 --> 04:25.330
I actually don't need to specify the type for now.

04:25.610 --> 04:29.490
We'll call it my script that just that's what my empty files called right now.

04:29.780 --> 04:32.390
And then I also want to connect it to a query.

04:32.390 --> 04:35.830
So again we just copy and paste to see the end point to do that here.

04:35.870 --> 04:40.570
You can either do it from the notes or from code that just queried dot com.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.080
So we have our east T.M. all set up.

04:43.180 --> 04:47.170
We're going to do now is style a little bit so that these buttons actually make sense.

04:47.170 --> 04:50.620
You can see here it can kind of click on these buttons right now but it's way too small.

04:51.540 --> 05:00.200
OK so to start off to see SS I'm going to call the board and then every button within that.

05:00.400 --> 05:12.500
And then let's give them all a whiff of 100 pixels about the Kallen and a height of 100 pixels going

05:12.500 --> 05:14.560
to save this.

05:14.600 --> 05:18.460
And here we can see we're starting to get something that looks quite a bit nicer.

05:18.460 --> 05:22.270
So if I zoom out a little bit here we now have our connect four board.

05:22.290 --> 05:28.970
Let's keep styling it a little more let's give them all the background color that's gray.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.770
Right now they have a bit of a fade to them.

05:32.130 --> 05:34.780
So if we refresh we can see they're all gray now.

05:35.190 --> 05:36.960
We'll give them a bit of a margin.

05:37.200 --> 05:43.440
So we have a little space in between them save that come appear refresh.

05:43.470 --> 05:44.730
That's nice.

05:44.730 --> 05:46.050
And let's make them round.

05:46.110 --> 05:52.710
So to make them round we use border radius and we can just set this to be at 50 percent and that should

05:52.710 --> 05:55.310
make them circles OK.

05:55.440 --> 06:00.240
And then we get this kind of a weird effect over here when we click and the way to get rid of that is

06:00.240 --> 06:07.720
by giving them a border will give them a four pixel solid black border.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.810
Save refresh.

06:10.090 --> 06:13.230
And here we can see our board is now complete.

06:13.300 --> 06:13.850
OK.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.360
So our HTL is done and our CSSA is done.

06:17.380 --> 06:20.020
Everything looks to be styled correctly.

06:20.020 --> 06:25.180
Coming up next we're going to be doing is dealing with the majority of our code which is all happening

06:25.390 --> 06:27.010
on the javascript's side.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.240
Thanks everyone and I'll see you in the next lecture.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.910
We're going to pick up right where we left off.

Hello everyone and welcome to the Jay queery section of the course.

00:09.440 --> 00:13.240
Let's briefly break down what Shakeri is and why you would want to use it.

00:13.250 --> 00:17.250
Keep in mind this course is not meant to be a full course on Javascript in any way.

00:17.270 --> 00:21.320
There is a lot more Javascript can do than what we've covered in this course and there are many other

00:21.320 --> 00:24.950
libraries for it such as angular re-act no jazz.

00:25.010 --> 00:29.000
Really this course is not going to cover any of those topics because they are outside the scope of this

00:29.000 --> 00:32.570
course and we won't really need them to build a full web application.

00:32.570 --> 00:38.210
What we do is we learn javascript and Jay query in order to use of Django later on.

00:38.220 --> 00:39.250
So what is Shakeri.

00:39.270 --> 00:44.630
Well Jay queery essentially just the javascript library and its a large single thought just file that

00:44.640 --> 00:48.270
has many pre-built methods and objects that really simplify your workflow.

00:48.390 --> 00:53.520
Specifically when you're interacting with the document object model and making HTP requests through

00:53.520 --> 00:56.860
the use of AJAX which we're going to talk about when we talk about Jing.

00:56.880 --> 01:02.930
Later on previously we've learned how to interact with a Dom using what's known as vanilla javascript

01:03.110 --> 01:07.910
which is another way of saying just plain javascript and we were able to use methods such as document

01:07.910 --> 01:14.610
Dockett element by id and later on we learned about methods such as document query selector when Jacqui

01:14.710 --> 01:15.880
was first created.

01:15.910 --> 01:20.980
The more robust and convenient method such as the query selector inquiry selector all actually didn't

01:20.980 --> 01:27.280
exist in vanilla javascript so J.Crew was created as a way to help simplify interactions with the Dom

01:27.430 --> 01:31.400
in one of its main features is the use of the dollar sign.

01:31.490 --> 01:32.960
So how do we actually get Jey query.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.140
Well you have two options.

01:34.160 --> 01:39.920
One is to link a CD and host that file like we did for we we're using bootstrap and then the other one

01:39.920 --> 01:44.450
is to actually download the database file from Jay cories official Web site and just link to it locally

01:44.450 --> 01:46.230
using a script tag.

01:46.250 --> 01:49.680
So again once you connect to the queries in the script tag and reached him L..

01:49.790 --> 01:54.730
Then you can call the specialized J.A.G. recalls that allow you to interact that Dom and eventually

01:54.740 --> 02:01.460
a few examples of how J.A.G. differs from a village javascript so on top of what a J.Crew call acts

02:01.460 --> 02:05.430
like and on the bottom we have what a vanilla javascript looks like.

02:05.570 --> 02:11.640
Here you can see that we basically replaced the document thok query selector all call in normal javascript.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.740
If a single dollar sign in here.

02:13.760 --> 02:19.970
Both of these Shakeri and vanilla javascript calls are grabbing all the elements that are under a div

02:19.970 --> 02:22.390
tag and hopefully just from this clear example.

02:22.400 --> 02:26.840
You can see they are going to save a lot of typing and a lot of work with the simple dollar sign command

02:26.840 --> 02:29.160
that Shakeri has.

02:29.240 --> 02:34.930
Let's imagine another situation where you actually want to edit the styling of a certain variable.

02:35.030 --> 02:43.050
So here with Jake Query we have some variable called E-L in here we've grabbed E-L and we said that

02:43.070 --> 02:48.180
C Ss border with and then set it to 20 pixels in vanilla javascript.

02:48.180 --> 02:53.250
You would have to call E-L dot style that border with is equal to 20 pixels.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.310
So hopefully I can see now that.

02:54.330 --> 03:01.150
Query basically allows you to just input any property of CSSA any style property directly using that

03:01.240 --> 03:05.820
CSSA method and then as a second argument what you want the change result to be.

03:05.820 --> 03:09.810
And that's a better workflow as far as being more robust.

03:11.470 --> 03:12.100
And then file it.

03:12.100 --> 03:17.150
Show you something that would be a function call with Cheikh query versus vanilla.

03:17.210 --> 03:22.190
So on the bottom here you have vanilla where you are saying is a document in a ready state loading.

03:22.460 --> 03:28.810
If not adding an event listener Dom content loading here Jay query can do this all in one simple line

03:28.850 --> 03:29.510
code.

03:31.530 --> 03:35.130
OK as you can see some situations are helped tremendously by a query.

03:35.220 --> 03:40.230
While others may not really necessitate it due to its massive popularity it's still very important to

03:40.230 --> 03:44.150
understand it because you're going to be running into it a lot in the real world.

03:44.150 --> 03:48.860
And if you didn't know J.A.G. you would end up reading someone else's code and just be flabbergasted

03:48.870 --> 03:51.830
why these dollar sign calls were everywhere.

03:51.840 --> 03:55.580
OK so let's start learning how to interact with the DOM with a query.

03:55.590 --> 03:56.720
I'll see at the next lecture.

00:05.050 --> 00:07.020
Hello everyone and welcome to part two.

00:07.030 --> 00:12.600
Jake queery events and this lecturer are going to be using the same H-2 him I'll file from the previous

00:12.600 --> 00:13.150
lecture.

00:13.170 --> 00:18.270
We're also going to be connecting it to a jazz file where we'll be using a query to work with events.

00:18.450 --> 00:21.390
Let's get started by hopping over to the editor in the browser.

00:21.690 --> 00:28.050
OK so we have the Tim L file from the previous lecture open here on the editor as well as linked to

00:28.160 --> 00:29.610
in the browser.

00:29.610 --> 00:32.730
Now we're going to be linking this to our own Javascript.

00:32.760 --> 00:38.970
So if we go all the way down here I've added a script tag with the source my script but Jesus just changed

00:38.970 --> 00:44.080
that to whatever dodgiest you have in the same directory as this HVM I'll file.

00:44.370 --> 00:45.890
Here's the empty that Jesus.

00:45.900 --> 00:50.130
And let's show you some basic event handling with Jake Query.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.590
First let's talk about clicks.

00:52.680 --> 00:57.620
Imagine you want to have the heading one here change when you click on it.

00:58.010 --> 01:05.510
Well you can do is say something like H-1 and then you have the event call.

01:05.580 --> 01:11.910
So that can be something like click and I going show you a link later on actually have it here open

01:11.910 --> 01:17.070
in my browser with all the different type of event methods you can call using a query.

01:17.070 --> 01:19.280
There are a ton of them available to you.

01:19.290 --> 01:22.130
We're going to be going over the most basic ones and the most useful ones.

01:22.170 --> 01:24.090
So that click is definitely one of those.

01:24.380 --> 01:27.490
And inside of this is where you pass in your function.

01:27.570 --> 01:34.350
They want to have executed when something it's clicked specifically having one element here.

01:34.350 --> 01:42.170
So we're going to let's just say we logged something first so there was a click we will save that and

01:42.180 --> 01:49.120
let's refresh this page and open up our console so we can actually see the log or me expand this a little

01:49.120 --> 01:49.530
bit.

01:49.540 --> 01:55.050
Here's a con. And I'm going to click on H-1 and I see there was a click.

01:55.060 --> 01:55.420
Perfect.

01:55.420 --> 01:57.460
So it's all working out.

01:57.490 --> 01:59.930
Now let's expand on this idea.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.800
Actually grabbing multiple elements.

02:03.990 --> 02:07.070
So there's only one heading one but what if I pass an ally.

02:07.350 --> 02:13.530
Well this is actually going to basically work automatically thanks to a query where if I say cancel

02:13.530 --> 02:18.910
that log any ally was clicked.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.090
Saved this.

02:21.090 --> 02:24.830
I refresh this page and click on any line item.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.860
You can see here that keeps getting repeated.

02:28.090 --> 02:30.750
Perfect.

02:30.760 --> 02:35.950
Now if you actually want to call methods or properties off whatever specific variable you're interacting

02:35.950 --> 02:38.920
with here you have to use the this keyword.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.370
Now let me show you an example of what that would look like.

02:41.410 --> 02:44.770
Imagine that I want to change the heading every time I click on it.

02:45.130 --> 02:52.540
Well what you can end up doing is you call dollar sign and imprint sees you pass in the this keyword

02:53.230 --> 02:59.620
and inside of an event call like this that this keyword is referring to whatever object you are currently

02:59.860 --> 03:01.420
performing that event on.

03:01.420 --> 03:06.700
So we have this and then the offer that you can call it just like the variables we saw in the previous

03:06.700 --> 03:07.150
lectures.

03:07.180 --> 03:16.650
If I want to change the text I just grab text and then say I was changed so I'll save that.

03:16.750 --> 03:20.070
And let's close this for now and refresh the page.

03:20.100 --> 03:25.850
I'm going to click on heading one here and we can see I was changed so again with Jake Query.

03:26.030 --> 03:31.480
You kind of have this funky keyboard with this but also in combination with the dollar sign.

03:31.760 --> 03:36.950
So if we have any event call instead of the function we want to actually affect what's going on here

03:37.220 --> 03:43.290
we have the dollar sign this and then dot in any of the previous methods we saw from the previous lecture.

03:43.620 --> 03:44.110
Okay.

03:44.330 --> 03:49.640
So that's the basics of clicks and there's also things like double clicks hover over mouseover.

03:49.640 --> 03:50.930
There's a lot of stuff like that.

03:51.050 --> 03:54.740
And if you want the complete reference they're all here and category events.

03:54.740 --> 03:57.170
For instance let's say we're looking for DoubleClick.

03:57.230 --> 04:01.210
Well it can expand this Z-Man.

04:01.400 --> 04:06.450
Let's say I'm looking for something to do if click or double click while I can start typing click.

04:06.680 --> 04:11.810
I see the event handler for click but I can keep searching and there I seen double click right below

04:11.810 --> 04:13.880
it with DBIL click.

04:13.970 --> 04:19.310
So that's what I would have to call that a click if I only wanted the event to listen for double click.

04:19.310 --> 04:20.080
All right.

04:20.090 --> 04:26.330
Now for events we are not just limited to things like clicks or mouse overs with just our mouse we can

04:26.330 --> 04:31.310
actually perform actions on our keyboard and that's known as a key press.

04:31.310 --> 04:37.500
Let's walk through a few examples of interacting the key press using Jake Query.

04:37.600 --> 04:42.800
I will use the dollar sign notation and grab the input tax.

04:43.010 --> 04:48.670
If we scroll down here we see we have to impot tags the text box right here and then submit.

04:48.680 --> 04:56.180
So I just want to grab the text one so I will say E Q 0 since it's the very first input that shows up

04:56.180 --> 04:57.140
on the page.

04:57.230 --> 05:05.490
And then I'm going to call a method he press on this and I will call a function to occur whenever I

05:05.490 --> 05:08.590
press a key inside of that text box.

05:08.820 --> 05:18.340
And what I'm going to have happen is I will change heading 3 I'm going to toggle it's class turn blue

05:20.240 --> 05:28.470
and let's save that I'll refresh my browser over here and now we'll see what happens as I begin to type

05:28.920 --> 05:30.050
in this box.

05:30.710 --> 05:37.580
You can see that the toggle class is toggling this turn blue on and off so again what's happening here.

05:37.590 --> 05:44.730
Well I'm grabbing all the input tags then indexing to grab the very first one is a text box and then

05:44.730 --> 05:50.610
assigning a key press method to it where every time I press a key inside the text box this function

05:50.610 --> 05:52.110
occurs in this function.

05:52.310 --> 05:57.600
Rab's the heading three tags toggles their class to be turned blue OK.

05:57.880 --> 06:02.170
Now we can actually grab an event object from this that has a ton of information.

06:02.170 --> 06:05.980
Now let me show you how we can do that inside of this function.

06:05.980 --> 06:15.040
I can input the special keyword events and I'm going to log this so I will say cancel dot log this event

06:15.080 --> 06:19.330
and you can see that it's highlighted to indicate that it's keyword.

06:19.430 --> 06:21.960
I'm going to refresh this page.

06:22.380 --> 06:29.160
And as I type you'll notice I get a console log and this is known as an event object and this event

06:29.220 --> 06:33.570
object has a ton of information on it which we're really not going to need to know.

06:33.660 --> 06:40.450
But if you scroll all the way down there's a which property here and if we click on that we see that

06:40.510 --> 06:48.520
which is equal to 97 and that corresponded with the letter a type B that I get a new object.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.550
Open it up.

06:49.720 --> 06:50.580
Click on a.

06:50.690 --> 06:54.300
And we see we have 98 by type the letter C.

06:54.760 --> 06:57.430
Open up the new event objects all the way down.

06:57.490 --> 07:03.850
I see I have ninety nine so there are actual number codes for every key on your keyboard which makes

07:03.850 --> 07:10.510
sense because maybe only one action to occur when I enter or press w or press an up and down arrow key

07:11.110 --> 07:17.920
which means we can actually specify events dot which to grab a particular code.

07:18.790 --> 07:23.050
So let's see that in action I'm going to say

07:26.690 --> 07:28.490
event which

07:31.060 --> 07:36.300
is equal to and I want to use the key code 13 which is the enter key.

07:40.630 --> 07:42.700
I will change heading 3

07:46.320 --> 07:58.520
Zuby toggle class turn blue and let's save this one to refresh the page.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.880
And now we should see that as I type stuff.

08:00.910 --> 08:07.100
Nothing really happens until I press enter which I know you can't see that the change occurs.

08:07.100 --> 08:12.490
So right now I'm just pressing enter on my keyboard and the changes occurring for any other key press.

08:12.490 --> 08:13.460
Nothing will happen.

08:13.720 --> 08:17.260
And that's how you can use the event object to grab information.

08:17.410 --> 08:23.080
And with key presses which will tell you a numeric code that corresponds to that key and you can just

08:23.080 --> 08:28.290
Google online for the numerical codes specific reason your keyboard.

08:28.430 --> 08:30.110
We're going to discuss two more things.

08:30.140 --> 08:34.970
And one is the method and the next one it will be effects and animations.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.220
But let's quickly show you what the method looks like.

08:39.350 --> 08:47.150
The method essentially acts like event at event listener from vanilla Javascript.

08:47.150 --> 08:58.020
So if I grab H-1 and say dot on I passen and events for instance let's passen double click

09:01.380 --> 09:02.790
and then I pass in the function

09:05.800 --> 09:15.990
and we can use a special this keyword to reference H-1 here I'll say this and we will toggle class to

09:15.990 --> 09:18.350
be turned blue.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.660
So it's happening here.

09:20.870 --> 09:27.000
I'm saying on DoubleClick call this function and this references the H-1.

09:27.010 --> 09:34.010
So if I refresh this page every time I double click on this it's going to toggle this on and off and

09:34.040 --> 09:37.580
my highlighting is making it seem a little weird because when your height when you double click something

09:37.820 --> 09:39.210
it also gets highlighted.

09:39.230 --> 09:44.390
Hopefully you can see when I'm trying to convey here and you can practice this on your computer to get

09:44.390 --> 09:45.450
a better idea of it.

09:46.330 --> 09:46.710
All right.

09:46.780 --> 09:48.940
So let's show one of my last example.

09:48.940 --> 09:54.660
This is basically just like an event listener so I can say something like mouse enter.

09:55.700 --> 10:01.760
Save this and this should actually be a lower Casey save that.

10:02.020 --> 10:09.290
And refresh our page and you'll see here as I mouse hovers over it suddenly turns into blue.

10:09.560 --> 10:13.020
And now I can talk with the class just by hovering off anon.

10:13.090 --> 10:19.150
So now I can just have a single call with toggle class instead of the dual calls we saw back when I

10:19.150 --> 10:22.720
was using vanilla javascript's OK.

10:22.750 --> 10:26.380
Finally let's talk about events and animations.

10:26.380 --> 10:28.120
Now you can go to API that J.

10:28.120 --> 10:32.700
Queried dot com categories slash effects to get more information about this.

10:32.890 --> 10:38.450
But basically you can have animations or effects occur.

10:38.670 --> 10:41.530
We'll show you some very common ones.

10:41.670 --> 10:49.150
I'm going to say input da e q and I'm going to grab the second input which we look back at the HDMI.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.550
It's the submit button.

10:50.550 --> 10:53.120
So I want something to happen when I click on submit.

10:53.440 --> 10:58.130
So I will say on click

11:00.690 --> 11:01.230
function

11:04.640 --> 11:09.090
and then I'm going to grab everything in the container class.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.430
Let's put this in quotes here.

11:14.820 --> 11:17.460
So grab everything in that container class.

11:18.590 --> 11:26.250
And say fade out and you can pass in a number here in milliseconds.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.120
So I like to refresh this.

11:28.170 --> 11:28.990
I hit submit.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.740
Let's close this before I do that.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.470
I'll eventually see everything fade out within 30 seconds.

11:34.470 --> 11:36.040
So what is actually going on here.

11:36.210 --> 11:39.730
Well this is just an animation that is available to update query.

11:40.020 --> 11:49.390
And basically it just fade out and you pasan a number of milliseconds that you want the fadeout to take.

11:49.400 --> 11:56.120
There are many many animations and effects available to you just to show you one more you can use slide

11:56.120 --> 11:56.810
up.

11:56.810 --> 11:57.920
I will save this.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.630
Let's refresh the page.

11:59.630 --> 12:06.320
And as I click Submit I can see everything starts to get slide up or basically a white and in order

12:06.320 --> 12:09.500
to get this back I just have to refresh.

12:09.930 --> 12:10.330
OK.

12:10.370 --> 12:17.370
So again there's a link in the notes or you can just go to a guide that just create icon slash category

12:17.370 --> 12:21.970
such effects to get the full list of all the effects available to here.

12:22.040 --> 12:26.690
We won't really be playing around these too much throughout the rest of the course but you may find

12:26.750 --> 12:32.530
when you're dealing with your own web site it may be fun to add in your own animation using Jake Weary.

12:32.540 --> 12:33.230
All right.

12:33.230 --> 12:36.730
So go ahead and check out the notes if you want to review anything we covered here.

12:37.010 --> 12:42.460
But hopefully you now realize that Shakeri makes your life really simple and a whole lot easier especially

12:42.460 --> 12:43.870
in working with the DOM.

12:43.880 --> 12:47.330
Coming up next we're going to have a Kinect for game project.

12:47.340 --> 12:53.150
We're actually going to make a working a fully working front and Web site that has a Kinect for game

12:53.150 --> 12:53.860
on it.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.840
Thanks everyone and I'll see in the next lecture.

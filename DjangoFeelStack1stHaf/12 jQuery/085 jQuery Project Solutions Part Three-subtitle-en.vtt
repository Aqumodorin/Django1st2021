00:01.790 --> 00:03.420
Hello everyone and welcome back.

00:03.530 --> 00:10.250
So far we've had the winning checks and the functions that actually check the colors and change the

00:10.250 --> 00:10.740
colors.

00:10.750 --> 00:17.960
What we need to do now is create all the game logic using Jake Query that will actually assign all this

00:17.960 --> 00:20.320
to happen on a click.

00:20.330 --> 00:23.960
So as I mentioned earlier this is kind of an extreme use of.

00:23.990 --> 00:29.930
Query you would probably want to use javascript to raise and more stuff on the back end if you're actually

00:29.930 --> 00:31.100
programming this.

00:31.220 --> 00:36.620
But this is kind of just to show the power of Jey query if you really want to force it to use the document

00:36.620 --> 00:42.000
object model manipulation I'm going to start with clear run.

00:42.060 --> 00:49.170
So I will say variable current player is equal to the number one.

00:49.320 --> 00:59.670
And then I will have the current name be equal to player 1 and then I will have the current color be

00:59.860 --> 01:06.260
equal to player color actually player 1 color.

01:06.270 --> 01:07.230
Excuse me.

01:07.250 --> 01:12.980
So we start off with player 1 So let's say that start with player 1

01:16.240 --> 01:22.030
and the next thing I want to do is change the heading to indicate that it's player 1 sign when he is

01:22.040 --> 01:22.580
Shakeri.

01:22.580 --> 01:30.080
Here the say H-3 text and say Player 1

01:33.120 --> 01:36.210
is your turn.

01:36.980 --> 01:40.620
Pick a column to drop in

01:46.040 --> 01:50.710
and then what I'm going to do is using Jake.

01:50.750 --> 01:53.670
I will say bored button

01:56.240 --> 02:05.660
on click all function and this function is basically going to call all my logic again probably normally

02:05.720 --> 02:06.960
not what you would want to do.

02:07.190 --> 02:11.140
But this is going to allow us to kind of show off what Jay creek can do that week.

02:11.210 --> 02:17.190
The fact that we can do this all through a dom call instead of saving the Ticketek to abort to an array

02:17.220 --> 02:18.620
or a nested array.

02:19.360 --> 02:26.130
So you're going to say a variable column and I'm going to need to recognize what column was chosen and

02:26.130 --> 02:29.320
I can do that with the this call here.

02:29.340 --> 02:34.170
So this keyword is going to indicate what column the person clicked on.

02:34.340 --> 02:45.130
And then I can actually say closest CD to find the closest cell to this and then get the index of that.

02:45.140 --> 02:46.320
So that's the column.

02:46.490 --> 02:52.700
And again there's a stack overflow link in the notes to indicate some terms that we didn't cover such

02:52.700 --> 03:01.140
as closest and then index that offer that we need to then get back the bottom available wrote the change.

03:01.170 --> 03:10.980
So I'm going to say this variable bottom avail is equal to bottom passing in that column.

03:13.050 --> 03:18.750
And then I want to drop the chip in the column that is at the bottom available Rho.

03:18.780 --> 03:21.600
So I will call change color.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.630
And passen bottom avail.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.350
CIOL and then current color

03:33.280 --> 03:36.090
and now we want to check if there's a win or a tie.

03:36.210 --> 03:42.650
Someone's going to say if there is a horizontal one check

03:46.050 --> 03:58.920
or there is a vertical in check or returns a Boolean OR there is a diagonal check.

03:59.170 --> 04:05.100
Then what I'm going to need to do is end the game and to indicate the game has ended.

04:05.100 --> 04:16.320
We can just do something like Jake queery call H-1 and change its text to say something like winning

04:16.740 --> 04:21.890
let's say whatever player we currently are on which is the current player.

04:25.200 --> 04:32.070
Actually it's going to be the current name current players just the actual number one which will show

04:32.070 --> 04:39.320
later on how we actually going to switch from player to player to say current name.

04:39.400 --> 04:46.270
You have one so we actually change the heading there and we can change some other things too we can

04:46.270 --> 04:46.960
do a fade out.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.650
So let's practice that.

04:48.750 --> 04:49.720
We're going to say

04:52.300 --> 04:52.850
three

04:55.620 --> 04:56.330
fade out.

04:56.350 --> 05:02.260
That's an animation that you can find on that Jay query link and then I'm also going to the same thing

05:02.260 --> 05:03.040
for H-2

05:05.830 --> 05:11.170
fade out and in the solutions this is actually done as a separate function.

05:11.170 --> 05:17.040
This whole Winchester is a separate function and is call on fast and you can also pass in milliseconds

05:17.040 --> 05:17.430
there.

05:19.680 --> 05:26.400
All right so if I get either a horizontal one check vertical uncheck or diagonal uncheck I'm going to

05:26.400 --> 05:30.170
change my heading one text to say current name you have one.

05:30.420 --> 05:35.460
And then I'm going to fade out fast fade out fast from the other three headings or two headings excuse

05:35.460 --> 05:36.480
me.

05:36.480 --> 05:43.030
Now what we to do is recheck who the current player is and change the current player.

05:43.050 --> 05:50.220
So if I'm still continuing after this it means there is no win or tie so I'm going to say the current

05:50.220 --> 05:58.850
player is equal to the current player times negative one.

05:58.980 --> 06:03.820
And then and when to use that actual number to change to re-assignment.

06:03.960 --> 06:11.660
So I will say if Kramm player is equal to a positive one will then I know where a player won.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.860
So I know the current name

06:15.920 --> 06:20.990
is Player 1 member that was the prompt from the very first lines of code.

06:21.230 --> 06:29.780
And then what I'm going to do is change using j query my heading 3 to say some text such as current

06:29.780 --> 06:34.230
name is your turn.

06:36.910 --> 06:45.720
And then else I noticed the other players names don't say current name is equal to Player 2.

06:46.950 --> 06:56.870
And then change the heading for player to we'll say H-3 text current name is your turn.

06:59.700 --> 07:07.910
And then I want to change the current colors as well so say current color is equal to Player 2 color.

07:07.910 --> 07:09.520
And let's do the same thing.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.230
Up here.

07:13.480 --> 07:24.320
So here I will say current color is equal to Player 2 color excuse me and player want to color

07:27.500 --> 07:31.290
so we can save that and then we can continue if it come up.

07:31.520 --> 07:36.560
I can change the color to the current color at the bottom available at that column.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.290
So this basically is going to keep cycling.

07:39.350 --> 07:44.400
Whenever I click the board and that is all you have to do to actually make connect for work.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.070
Now I know you say that's all you have to do.

07:46.070 --> 07:51.370
This is quite a bit of effort especially since we're really trying to juice the most out of J query

07:51.680 --> 07:53.360
instead of using something like an array.

07:53.570 --> 07:57.070
Well let's actually save this and refresh our page and see if it works.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.970
Going to refresh.

07:58.970 --> 08:04.560
I get player 1 into your name let's call it a player to enter your name.

08:04.570 --> 08:06.180
Let's call it be.

08:06.430 --> 08:09.670
Well OK let's see if I can drop it.

08:09.670 --> 08:10.430
Great.

08:10.450 --> 08:13.490
Now it says it's your turn or should say be it.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.100
It is your turn.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.470
So we will keep dropping it.

08:17.630 --> 08:18.890
Now we can see here.

08:19.190 --> 08:24.460
Let's practice getting it vertical in and says Be you have one perfect.

08:24.550 --> 08:26.440
And then I just have to refresh the page.

08:26.530 --> 08:32.380
I'll start again with a and then B let's get a horizontal one here.

08:35.020 --> 08:39.570
And looks Whoops I accidentally clicked too many times but I also got the horizontal win.

08:39.610 --> 08:43.530
And now let's make sure the that no one is working as well.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.660
So make some player names.

08:45.820 --> 08:48.780
It's just junk and let's make those names.

08:48.790 --> 08:52.500
We'll say try to get blue to be the admiral here.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.510
Now we're going to keep going.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.260
And there's the diagonal in.

08:58.470 --> 08:59.060
Great.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.030
All right.

09:00.030 --> 09:01.110
Do you have any questions for this.

09:01.110 --> 09:06.510
Feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums with something I want to make clear is really just an exercise to show

09:06.510 --> 09:11.840
its possible with Jake queery and the front end stack that we learned you would probably want to do

09:11.850 --> 09:17.460
most of this sort of stuff either on the back end or by taking advantage of javascript's data structures

09:17.460 --> 09:18.540
like an array.

09:18.600 --> 09:24.270
Especially for this type of problem you would not want to have so much logic on just a simple click

09:24.570 --> 09:25.290
with all this.

09:25.290 --> 09:26.110
Jake Query.

09:26.260 --> 09:28.680
This is more just to show how much you can.

09:28.690 --> 09:31.640
Jake Query given what we know so far.

09:32.000 --> 09:32.490
Okay.

09:32.760 --> 09:33.540
Thanks everyone.

09:33.540 --> 09:37.850
And I will see at the next section of the course we're going to begin our move to the BASKINS.

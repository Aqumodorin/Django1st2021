00:05.000 --> 00:10.480
Hello everyone and welcome back to part one basic Jake Weary in this lecture we're going to start off

00:10.480 --> 00:15.700
learning how to interact with the DOM with a query and the file for this lecture is part 1 underscore

00:15.790 --> 00:17.270
my document thought East hymnal.

00:17.500 --> 00:21.370
We're going to be using the Council for our commands but we're also going to show you how you can link

00:21.370 --> 00:23.560
your own age T.M. file to Jake queery.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.650
Let's hop over to the browser to get started.

00:25.860 --> 00:26.200
OK.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.790
Here you have my editor open with the file it just referenced part 1.

00:29.790 --> 00:34.390
My document and then also have it linked here in my browser as well as code.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.030
Jay queried dot com.

00:36.040 --> 00:39.310
First I want to briefly walk through the sage Tim L file.

00:39.310 --> 00:46.540
You'll notice here I have a style call and that's basically just in lieu of a CSSA she but I have a

00:46.540 --> 00:52.720
turn blue class which is a color white background blue and then a turn red class which has the text

00:52.720 --> 00:54.790
color be white or the background be red.

00:54.790 --> 00:57.720
So keep that in mind as we continue through this lecture.

00:57.910 --> 01:04.450
But you'll also notice that not only do I have a link to bootstrap but I also have a script call here

01:04.540 --> 01:09.020
that connects me to Jake Query and let me show you how you can actually grab that yourself.

01:09.860 --> 01:19.180
All you have to do is go to code that Jay queried dot com that's C O D E J Q U E R Y that c o m and

01:19.190 --> 01:23.690
this will take you to this Web site showing you the latest stable versions of the CD and for a query

01:24.200 --> 01:29.180
and then you can just come here and we're going to be using J.A.G. theory and you'll have a couple of

01:29.180 --> 01:31.380
options uncompressed magnified.

01:31.460 --> 01:33.120
Slim and slim fine.

01:34.490 --> 01:38.610
Basically these are just variations on how large the file size is.

01:38.690 --> 01:44.200
If you get an compress That's the largest possible if you do in a fight that's probably the smallest

01:44.210 --> 01:45.180
possible.

01:45.240 --> 01:49.880
Now what you can do is just click on any of these so we can do fully and compress and you can just copy

01:49.880 --> 01:55.610
this and then paste it into your file and that will give you the source for the actual that yes.

01:56.150 --> 02:00.590
And if you're interested in this you can actually just copy this link right here.

02:02.490 --> 02:07.260
And then put it into your browser and this will actually be the entire database file.

02:07.260 --> 02:12.530
So this is what Jay Korea's just this really large file and this is the uncompress version.

02:12.540 --> 02:18.690
If you come back here and check out the slim modified version we click on that link and then grab that

02:19.470 --> 02:22.180
HTP and put that in your browser.

02:22.410 --> 02:27.500
You'll notice that this is a much slimmer and way more condense so it makes for a smaller file because

02:27.500 --> 02:32.820
those that have as much white space although Good luck reading this because it's frankly a way to compress

02:32.820 --> 02:35.130
for any normal person to read it.

02:35.160 --> 02:35.820
All right.

02:35.820 --> 02:36.410
Living along.

02:36.420 --> 02:41.430
Let's get started with selecting OK query what I'm going to do now is just expand this.

02:42.870 --> 02:50.350
And then open up my Consul here so I will inspect opened up my console and now I'm ready to go.

02:50.360 --> 02:54.980
So to confirm that you have Jay queery loaded what you should do is just type in a single dollar sign

02:55.600 --> 02:58.930
enter and if you see some function come out then you know that J.

02:58.940 --> 03:05.630
Korea has been loaded and you can test this again by saying dollar sign and then passing in a tag that

03:05.630 --> 03:06.770
you want to grab.

03:06.770 --> 03:12.350
So if you're using J.A.G. you want to grab everything off a tag you can just type in dollar sign and

03:12.350 --> 03:14.820
then in print sees whatever tag you're interested in.

03:15.020 --> 03:22.730
So for example for Heading 1 if I get that then I get back everything that has having one as a object

03:22.760 --> 03:23.250
there.

03:23.420 --> 03:31.910
And for example if I want to grab all the list items I say ally and then I get back what is sort of

03:31.910 --> 03:32.450
like an array.

03:32.450 --> 03:38.630
It's not quite energy but it basically acts like one as far as indexing purposes of the list items.

03:38.690 --> 03:41.210
And then you'll notice that I have a special list.

03:41.270 --> 03:43.500
So one of these has an idea special.

03:44.050 --> 03:50.010
OK let's save this to a variable or say a car and we'll call my variable x.

03:50.150 --> 04:01.060
Say dollar sign Heading 1 enter and then with this with Jay query activated if I want to edit any of

04:01.060 --> 04:08.320
the CSSA properties it's really easy I just say X Dotsie SS and then it takes in two parameters.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.640
The first one being the CSSA property.

04:10.690 --> 04:14.890
So let's say the color and then the second one being whatever you want to change it to.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.690
So let's change heading 1 to be red.

04:18.010 --> 04:21.890
And there you see immediately on top there selecting take cre has been turned red now.

04:22.110 --> 04:29.890
And if I want to change the background I can say anything like CSI assess background and then passen

04:29.900 --> 04:30.990
another color looks.

04:31.010 --> 04:33.300
For instance make it really obvious of blue.

04:33.290 --> 04:35.210
So you can see now that work in J.

04:35.210 --> 04:37.390
Crew just makes your life a whole lot easier.

04:37.450 --> 04:40.660
And especially using Django later on in the course.

04:40.760 --> 04:47.960
Now you can edit multiple CSSA properties at once instead of just passing in one argument and one parameter

04:48.140 --> 04:51.310
we end up doing is just passing in an object.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.670
Let me show you what that looks like.

04:53.550 --> 05:03.020
So I can say a variable Meucci SS and this will be an object so I'm going to be creating a javascript

05:03.050 --> 05:04.060
object right now.

05:04.760 --> 05:08.230
But I remember it basically acts like a dictionary.

05:08.240 --> 05:11.620
So here I'll change the color to be white.

05:11.720 --> 05:15.500
I will change the background to be blue.

05:17.250 --> 05:25.890
Which is essentially going to be keeping it blue and then I'm going to create the border CBR read and

05:25.890 --> 05:29.270
then let's finish off our objects.

05:29.310 --> 05:34.280
If I see Meucci SS I see I have this javascript object.

05:34.420 --> 05:41.540
And now what I can do is say X dot Z assess pass my javascript object and then that's going to change

05:41.720 --> 05:42.710
all of them at once.

05:42.710 --> 05:47.130
So you can see it has now a border read although you can't really see the border.

05:47.300 --> 05:52.510
So let's edit that a little more let's make the border something like

05:55.180 --> 06:06.560
20 pixel AUPs pixels solid red and let's change the background to be something like Green hit enter

06:07.290 --> 06:14.610
and let's run ex-Nazi SS You see us again and here we can see the green the red and the white.

06:14.660 --> 06:19.400
All right let's revisit the topic of grabbing multiple objects at once so we already saw that with the

06:19.760 --> 06:20.440
list items.

06:20.450 --> 06:29.150
But let me clear the page and show that again if I create a variable and call it list items and set

06:29.150 --> 06:35.200
it equal to everything that has a list tag I get back if I check it out.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.920
What essentially looks like an array.

06:36.920 --> 06:43.040
Now technically this is not a javascript array it acts more like what's known as a list in javascript

06:43.040 --> 06:48.740
or a node list but instead what we're going to be showing you is how you can index particular items

06:48.830 --> 06:49.690
off of this.

06:49.700 --> 06:56.180
So if I call list items and say Dotsie SS and change the style.

06:56.210 --> 07:04.590
So for instance I say color is blue then it changes everything of a list tag.

07:04.930 --> 07:07.730
We look at this to the color blue.

07:07.780 --> 07:14.590
If I only want to grab one of them what I can do is use the dot EQM method to grab a particular index

07:14.650 --> 07:15.600
item.

07:15.880 --> 07:23.290
And the way that works is you say list items dot each queue and then pass on the number of the index

07:23.290 --> 07:23.650
you want.

07:23.650 --> 07:29.410
So for the very first one it's going to be 0 and then off of this you can call CSSA and change whatever

07:29.410 --> 07:30.850
properties you want.

07:30.850 --> 07:38.140
So let's change that color to something more obvious like orange.

07:38.220 --> 07:44.070
And if we come back here expand this I can see now the very first item in that list has been changed

07:44.070 --> 07:48.110
to orange and everything else is has retained the color blue.

07:48.120 --> 07:52.660
Now you can also grab the last item by saying list items.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.320
Q And then using negative indexing.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.260
So negative one will then return the last item.

07:58.290 --> 08:01.280
So let's make that color something like.

08:01.290 --> 08:03.110
Well let's just make it orange as well.

08:03.300 --> 08:04.270
We'll hit enter.

08:04.380 --> 08:09.000
And if we scroll down here we see now that last item is orange.

08:09.030 --> 08:09.670
OK.

08:09.840 --> 08:12.760
Now let's talk about grabbing text and HVM.

08:12.810 --> 08:17.220
Remember Previously we had to use things like enraged him or text content.

08:17.220 --> 08:18.880
Jay Kareem makes that much easier.

08:19.720 --> 08:27.260
So I'm going to say dollar sign H-1 and I don't even really have to save it as a variable I can just

08:27.260 --> 08:33.210
call the method or property right here and it's going to be text.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.500
So this says selecting J.

08:34.510 --> 08:36.800
Crew member that's a text to have appear.

08:36.910 --> 08:37.900
If I want to change that.

08:37.910 --> 08:48.650
All I have to do is pass in whatever new text I want so I will say brand new text and that changes the

08:48.650 --> 08:49.160
text.

08:49.160 --> 08:53.960
So again it's just the variable or in this case I haven't even save the two variable just the dollar

08:53.960 --> 09:00.090
sign call and then that text whatever text you want if you want to actually change the HVM L.

09:00.290 --> 09:10.610
All you have to do is say again either your variable or your tag call and then you can say HVM L. close

09:10.610 --> 09:12.450
friend sees that returns the actually him.

09:12.460 --> 09:14.320
In this case there's nothing special about it.

09:14.630 --> 09:22.070
But if I want to edit the aged him out let's make it emphasized and going to say am new and then close

09:22.180 --> 09:25.140
E-M And just like before.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.900
You can't do this if just a text call.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.600
Otherwise it won't actually take the tags into effect.

09:30.740 --> 09:34.760
And here you can see up on the top that is in a Taluk.

09:34.770 --> 09:37.040
Now we're emphasized text.

09:37.100 --> 09:37.910
OK.

09:38.060 --> 09:42.470
Finally let's talk about two more things attributes and values and then classes.

09:42.680 --> 09:47.190
So attributes and values are also very easy to deal with.

09:47.210 --> 09:52.970
When you're working Ojay query for instance if we scroll to the bottom of this page we see we have an

09:52.970 --> 09:54.170
input button.

09:54.170 --> 10:01.580
So we have this form with some stuff and initially it says to your name or something and then we can

10:01.580 --> 10:08.300
click on submit when I'm going to do is I'm going to grab anything that has input so we can see there's

10:08.300 --> 10:09.830
two of these.

10:09.830 --> 10:11.660
There's the first one and then the second one.

10:11.660 --> 10:19.650
So both of these this text box and the submit button you know what I'm going to be doing here is say

10:19.650 --> 10:22.500
input.

10:22.660 --> 10:31.190
Q 1 and then if I want to actually effect the attribute of one of these inputs and remember the attribute

10:31.190 --> 10:36.890
can be something like what type of input it is rummer or creating an input in each T.M. I have to specify

10:36.980 --> 10:43.420
what type it is whether it's a button a radio button checkbox submit text area etc..

10:43.730 --> 10:50.840
So all I have to say is a TTR and then just like with CSSA the first argument is whatever the attribute

10:50.840 --> 10:52.140
you're looking for.

10:52.160 --> 10:56.960
So I will effect the type and then the second one is what you actually want to change that attribute

10:56.960 --> 10:57.710
to.

10:57.800 --> 11:03.770
In this case let's change the type 2 checkbox and now that I've hit enter I can see that submit button

11:03.770 --> 11:08.910
went away and it's now a checkbox on my screen.

11:08.910 --> 11:12.810
All right let's show another way to effect a value.

11:12.810 --> 11:21.000
So if I want to affect the value of this input text box here what I can do is grab anything with input

11:21.780 --> 11:26.170
and then when I'm going to say is dot e q grab the first item there.

11:26.190 --> 11:32.310
So I want to affect that text box and then say V.L. which is going to be the value and it's just a single

11:32.310 --> 11:36.960
parameter here because we're specifically saying I want to affect the value of that text box.

11:36.960 --> 11:44.970
So I will say you value enter and I see a text box value has been changed to new value and that's special

11:45.000 --> 11:49.340
with the dot the A-L call.

11:49.490 --> 11:53.550
Now finally Whoops I want to discuss classes.

11:53.600 --> 11:59.750
So remember we have C SS classes and if we go back to our HTL document here I see I have two classes

11:59.780 --> 12:01.530
turn blue and turn red.

12:01.790 --> 12:06.680
So it's something to keep in mind when let refresh this page so we can get everything back to normal.

12:06.980 --> 12:07.570
OK.

12:07.770 --> 12:11.250
And let me show you how you can add a class with Shakeri.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.410
All you have to do is have a dollar sign here.

12:14.430 --> 12:16.510
Select something so let's select the header.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.930
In this case it's a one or actually yeah.

12:19.950 --> 12:20.540
H-1.

12:20.600 --> 12:27.380
And then if you want to add a class you have to do is call at class and then the name of the class.

12:27.470 --> 12:34.720
So let's say turn read and then we can see it turned red but I want to remove a class.

12:34.790 --> 12:36.770
It's very similar process.

12:37.010 --> 12:40.870
Call H-1 and then call da remove.

12:40.870 --> 12:46.500
Class and then we can remove turn red.

12:46.510 --> 12:53.050
Now usually what you end up wanting to do is toggle class not just add a class because if we already

12:53.050 --> 12:58.290
have the read class on it we want to remove the read class if it doesn't have the read class already.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.820
Then we want to add it the way you can do that is by using toggle.

13:02.050 --> 13:03.390
So let me show you what I mean.

13:03.790 --> 13:08.370
I'm going to call H-1 again Elicia with blue class.

13:08.440 --> 13:19.360
So I will say toggle class turn blue and you can see it turned blue.

13:19.360 --> 13:23.930
But if I run the exact same line of code again toggle class it will turn it back off.

13:24.190 --> 13:27.200
So you can see that it's toggle it on and off.

13:27.250 --> 13:30.170
So now you don't have to worry about class and or move class.

13:30.190 --> 13:32.370
You can just use toggle class instead.

13:32.380 --> 13:36.880
It really depends on your situation whether or not you want to use class or just a simple add or remove

13:36.880 --> 13:39.700
call but know that you have the option there.

13:39.760 --> 13:40.280
All right.

13:40.420 --> 13:44.190
That's really all I wanted to talk about for Jay queery for this particular lecture.

13:44.230 --> 13:48.430
Hopefully you saw how easy it is to work with a query and if you want a reference for all the commands

13:48.430 --> 13:54.340
we just showed you can just go to part one basic J queried that J.S. under the Shakeri folder and it

13:54.340 --> 13:58.900
has all the commands in a javascript file that we went through here in the con..

13:58.900 --> 14:00.760
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.

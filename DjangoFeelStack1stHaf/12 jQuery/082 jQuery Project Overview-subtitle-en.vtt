Hello everyone and welcome to part three the front end project for this project we're going to be coding

00:11.560 --> 00:16.950
through the creation of a Kinect for game and we're going to be heavily using j crew for this project.

00:17.200 --> 00:21.480
And just a quick no we probably are using J.Crew more than we actually should.

00:21.490 --> 00:25.630
So I really want to focus your knowledge of J.A.G. for this project.

00:25.630 --> 00:31.390
We will be using j creates actually built the Kinect for game when in reality it would probably be a

00:31.390 --> 00:35.680
smart idea just to use Badillo javascript arrays for a lot of the work here.

00:35.710 --> 00:38.440
We're going to be interacting with the Dom really heavily.

00:38.470 --> 00:39.560
So keep that in mind.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.630
We're going to be really focusing on Jay queery for this project.

00:42.640 --> 00:47.800
There are many many ways you could have build a connect for game using the front end stack that we know

00:47.800 --> 00:54.200
so far this is just one way that heavily features Jake queery and Dom.

00:54.310 --> 00:56.350
So this project is also completely optional.

00:56.350 --> 01:01.210
Feel free to only watch to skip a completely ordinary sackless straight on your own.

01:01.210 --> 01:04.380
This project will conclude our formal coverage of the front end stack.

01:04.380 --> 01:09.190
So really if you've reached this point Pat yourself on the back you've learned a ton already and you've

01:09.190 --> 01:11.810
basically completed the entire front end stack.

01:12.010 --> 01:16.900
And after this we'll be talking about the back end with Python and Django.

01:16.960 --> 01:20.410
All right let's take a look at what this project actually looks like when completed.

01:20.500 --> 01:24.610
And then you can decide how you want to approach the project after that in the next few lectures we're

01:24.610 --> 01:26.490
going to be coding through the solution.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.360
Let's hop over to my browser and show you what the project looks like.

01:29.590 --> 01:29.830
OK.

01:29.830 --> 01:31.360
This is what the project looks like.

01:31.360 --> 01:36.430
Upon starting the project you get an alert that says Player 1 enter your name you'll be blue.

01:36.640 --> 01:43.370
So I will just input player 1 and then player to enter your name.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.280
You will be red.

01:44.300 --> 01:49.990
So he can give this some other name just give it the name be you hit enter and then we see the screen

01:49.990 --> 01:50.990
so says welcome to Connect.

01:50.990 --> 01:56.630
For the object of this game's connect for your chips in a row and player one player to alternate.

01:56.810 --> 02:02.720
But the thing is you only get to pick a column and that is the column where you're going to drop either

02:02.720 --> 02:05.850
your blue or red chip and it has to go all the way down.

02:05.870 --> 02:08.820
So for player 1 to turn so we can pick this column.

02:08.870 --> 02:11.230
Now we can see our chip dropped all the way down.

02:11.450 --> 02:15.850
So as Player B if I also pick that column it drops on top of that one.

02:16.050 --> 02:19.170
Now we can continue this process until someone has won the game.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.340
Hopefully you're already familiar.

02:20.340 --> 02:23.090
Connect Four If not you can always just read the rules.

02:23.090 --> 02:25.380
It's a very simple game.

02:25.430 --> 02:26.780
So here let's have blue win.

02:26.780 --> 02:32.540
By correcting for and once we've connected four it says Player 1 has one refresh your browser replay

02:32.600 --> 02:33.220
again.

02:33.290 --> 02:35.950
And if I refresh my browser I get the alerts again.

02:35.960 --> 02:42.560
So I will give player one a player to be in here that javascript's has loaded and I'm ready to play

02:42.560 --> 02:43.210
again.

02:43.310 --> 02:45.260
And that's really all there is this game.

02:45.260 --> 02:50.760
So feel free to either completely skip this project tackle it completely on your own or just have a

02:50.750 --> 02:52.850
code along section with me.

02:52.850 --> 02:54.810
Coming up in the next few lectures.

02:54.920 --> 02:55.680
Thanks everyone.

02:55.680 --> 02:56.750
And I'll see you at the next lecture.

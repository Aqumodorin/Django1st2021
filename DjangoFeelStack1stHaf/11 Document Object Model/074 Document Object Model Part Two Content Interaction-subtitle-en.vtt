00:04.670 --> 00:09.900
Well everyone and welcome to part two content interaction in this lecture.

00:09.900 --> 00:15.110
We're going to be seeing more examples of how to interact with the c.m. from the document object model.

00:15.180 --> 00:19.950
We'll show you how to do things such as change text change the age to smell code and affect the attributes

00:20.630 --> 00:24.250
the relevant files for the structure are part to content that H.T. T.M..

00:24.330 --> 00:29.130
That's the actual file how open my browser and part to interact but yes that's just the copy of all

00:29.130 --> 00:31.590
the commands I'll be inputting into the console.

00:31.590 --> 00:35.790
Let's get started by opening up to content buddy T.M. in our browser.

00:36.470 --> 00:40.790
All right so here we have the HTL document open and we're going to be doing is showing you how to change

00:40.790 --> 00:44.910
the text it's him all content and attributes with the actual Dom.

00:44.930 --> 00:50.860
So imagine that you've used queery selector to actually select an element from the document object model

00:51.020 --> 00:52.400
and you call that variable.

00:52.400 --> 00:58.320
My variable then you could use some of these methods to actually affect or interact with it.

00:58.430 --> 01:03.230
So we could call my variable dot text content and that returns the actual text.

01:03.290 --> 01:07.120
So you could set that equal to some new text if you wanted to change the text or whatever.

01:07.240 --> 01:13.310
Team l variable you're messing around with or if you want it to actually affect the T.M. and have effects

01:13.310 --> 01:16.170
on things such as the strong tags or the emphasis tags.

01:16.340 --> 01:21.770
You could do something like inner or excuse me inner H.T. a male and that returns the actual age to

01:21.770 --> 01:27.840
a male if you want to effect attributes or interact with them you can use the doc get attribute or the

01:28.100 --> 01:30.110
set attribute.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.550
Now let's show some actual examples of all this.

01:32.670 --> 01:36.290
Here I'm going to be actually manipulating this page and I'm looking at right now.

01:36.330 --> 01:39.800
So again to edit styles you've already seen we can use the dot style tag.

01:39.810 --> 01:43.490
Now we're going to show you how to edit actually email or text or attributes.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.570
So I'm going to grab this paragraph right here that I'm highlighting.

01:47.640 --> 01:52.060
Let's show you how we can do that or create a new variable let's call it P for paragraph.

01:52.110 --> 01:54.820
Although you can probably call it whatever you want.

01:55.660 --> 02:05.240
Well say document dot query selector and I'm going to grab the paragraph tag here and if I type paragraph

02:05.870 --> 02:11.450
I can see I have the paragraph tag and I can expand this to actually view everything that says to edit

02:11.450 --> 02:12.080
styles.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.260
I see there's a link here it's attributes.

02:14.300 --> 02:18.050
So if I click on this attributes link it takes me to Google dot com.

02:18.080 --> 02:24.270
So here I see Google opening up now what you actually want to do is change some of the text here.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
So I will clear this and I'm going to say P Di

02:32.900 --> 02:36.950
text content and I can set it equal to any thing that I want.

02:36.950 --> 02:40.630
So let's call it all new text.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.630
And then hit enter.

02:43.750 --> 02:46.540
And now I see that I've actually changed the text here.

02:46.630 --> 02:48.730
So it says new text.

02:48.730 --> 02:52.080
Now imagine that I wanted to make the text bold.

02:52.420 --> 03:03.220
Well what I can't do is this I'm not able to say text content and then passen a strong tag and say something

03:03.220 --> 03:10.690
like I'm bold closing strong tag.

03:10.720 --> 03:15.010
The reason I'm not able to do something like this I will see why what happens is because I'm just grabbing

03:15.010 --> 03:16.190
the text content.

03:16.420 --> 03:20.260
If I actually want to affect the age T.M. I need to grab the inner h tim L.

03:20.500 --> 03:26.750
So I will say P dot inner HVM L and I'm going set it equal now to I previously did.

03:26.770 --> 03:33.710
So let's grab this and just copy and paste it back grab it with the quotes and then hit enter.

03:33.770 --> 03:38.940
And I can see now my paragraph is in bold says I'm bold and I can see that it's darker.

03:39.020 --> 03:44.180
So that's different between text content and each T.M. if you want to actually pass in HTL tax when

03:44.210 --> 03:49.430
you're interacting with the HTML then you're going to need to call in each team instead of just text

03:49.430 --> 03:50.690
content.

03:50.690 --> 03:55.430
Now let's show you how you can get attributes and set attributes.

03:55.480 --> 04:00.430
So if we look down here there's a link to Facebook all the way here at the end so click on this.

04:00.430 --> 04:05.450
It takes me to Facebook and says I'm another Hetter with the special I.D. so don't worry about that

04:05.460 --> 04:06.320
for right now.

04:06.610 --> 04:13.880
Instead what I'm going to do is clear my console and I'm going to grab everything with the special I.D.

04:14.900 --> 04:25.490
so I'll save our special as equal to document weary selector and remember it's night.

04:25.520 --> 04:34.920
So I say hashtags and say I can use CSSA style selectors and then say special and again you would use

04:37.640 --> 04:38.530
there.

04:39.130 --> 04:44.020
And again you would have to know that there's a special I.D. in the HP M-L here it's actually telling

04:44.020 --> 04:47.930
me that but you'd have to actually reference the symbol to know this.

04:47.980 --> 04:51.260
So it's not like special is just some sort of normal ID.

04:51.370 --> 04:57.690
So here I can see now if I type in special I have heading for IDs with a special.

04:57.820 --> 04:59.020
It says I'm in the header.

04:59.050 --> 05:00.750
Looks like the header has emphasis.

05:00.970 --> 05:04.800
And then I also see h ref to Facebook dot com.

05:05.050 --> 05:06.680
Now how can I actually change this.

05:06.880 --> 05:17.140
Well I can say this I can say variable special a is equal to.

05:17.200 --> 05:25.530
And then I'm going to grab special dot and I will do a query selector on that LCA query selector grabbed

05:25.530 --> 05:26.120
the anchor incontact

05:28.960 --> 05:35.910
enter and now when I see special 8 I see that I only grab Denker tag so i can see that I can actually

05:36.180 --> 05:42.240
call multiple queries selectors until I actually find or get what I'm looking for.

05:42.240 --> 05:47.520
So here's the ref it goes to Facebook dot com actually want to get just the attribute.

05:47.820 --> 05:49.140
I can say special

05:53.030 --> 06:02.310
attribute and then I can grab the Tref itself if I only want to grab that link if I want to change the

06:02.310 --> 06:04.980
attribute that I need to use the same attribute.

06:05.280 --> 06:13.000
So I need to say especially the set attribute and the stakes in two arguments the attribute that you

06:13.000 --> 06:15.170
want to change.

06:15.340 --> 06:18.510
And then the actual value you want to change it to.

06:18.520 --> 06:24.440
So I'll say HTP Yes and let's change it to something like Amazon.com

06:28.870 --> 06:33.040
we hit enter and now we've actually changed this to Amazon.com.

06:33.260 --> 06:37.940
So if I click on this link instead of Facebook we see that it takes me to Amazon.

06:38.420 --> 06:38.750
All right.

06:38.750 --> 06:43.250
So that's the general way of using these four methods member text content is just for returning the

06:43.250 --> 06:46.440
text interchange team l returns the actual each T.M..

06:46.580 --> 06:51.890
And if you want to effect attributes within something you need to do it with set attribute if you want

06:51.890 --> 06:56.450
to just grab the attribute and get say attribute if you want to change it instead of doing just an equal

06:56.450 --> 07:01.190
sign like we said earlier you said attribute where the first argument is the actual attribute and the

07:01.190 --> 07:03.530
second argument is what you want to set it to.

07:03.530 --> 07:07.370
All right thanks everyone if you have any questions feel free to post to the Q&amp;A forums.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.770
And I'm happy to help you out.

07:08.780 --> 07:09.770
I'll see you at the next lecture.

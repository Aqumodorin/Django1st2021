Hello everyone and welcome back in this lecture we're going to be coding out the solutions for the game

00:09.050 --> 00:13.610
project that tic tac toe project when the previous lecture Hopefully you had a chance to attempt it

00:13.610 --> 00:14.190
on your own.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.450
But if not feel free to code along with me.

00:16.460 --> 00:19.720
Right now I'm going to hop over to my editor and browser to get started.

00:20.760 --> 00:27.270
OK here I am at my editor and here's the browser and I have three files open and empty HVM file in MTC

00:27.270 --> 00:32.550
SS file and an empty javascript files are ready to really tackle the front end and see its capabilities.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.620
With this little project of ours.

00:34.800 --> 00:39.910
Let's start off by creating the HTML file and filling out the actual content that will style it and

00:39.900 --> 00:46.730
then will actually add the interactivity with javascript going to type HTL there just to set it up.

00:46.740 --> 00:52.840
We have tic tac toe and let's actually link our CSSA file.

00:53.210 --> 00:57.840
So I'm going to link right now to my CSSA file which I've just called.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.730
Game C Ss.

00:59.910 --> 01:02.050
And then I'm also going to link to bootstrap.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.100
That way I can use the jumbo translator.

01:04.170 --> 01:11.100
All you have to do to do that comes to get bootstrap But come in then I can just scroll down here and

01:11.100 --> 01:14.800
grab the latest comp. The minute vide see SS.

01:14.940 --> 01:18.200
Copy and paste that line into my file.

01:18.200 --> 01:24.680
Now let's check the we're ready to go by just putting a heading in here saying connected.

01:25.020 --> 01:27.890
Make sure that font looks good refresh or page.

01:27.930 --> 01:31.550
And here we have connected in Bootstrap So we know we're good to go.

01:31.950 --> 01:36.370
OK so far my links are OK and I also want to link to my script.

01:36.420 --> 01:43.900
Let's just do that over here at the bottom so all the way at the bottom going to call script.

01:44.810 --> 01:53.290
And we're going to make the source equal to my script which is called My script G-S will save that and

01:53.290 --> 01:59.160
to verify that's connected I'm going to do a console log that says connected save.

01:59.170 --> 02:04.610
That will refresh this page and then let's inspect B at the console.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.880
Expand this just so we can see it and it's connected.

02:07.900 --> 02:09.160
So we're good to go there.

02:09.610 --> 02:10.640
Fantastic.

02:10.660 --> 02:15.360
Now we need to create some HTL content to actually create the board.

02:15.370 --> 02:19.660
Let's comment this out and then coming back to main.

02:20.020 --> 02:21.570
Let's expand this.

02:21.580 --> 02:27.100
First thing you wanted to do is since we're dealing with bootstrap create a DIV tag that contains the

02:27.100 --> 02:35.660
class container so this will have the container class and then inside of this I'm going to create the

02:35.660 --> 02:36.300
jumbo from

02:39.470 --> 02:48.310
now we'll have a heading and say this jumbo tron says welcome to tic tac toe tic tac toe and we can

02:48.310 --> 02:53.350
put a paragraph in here if we want says get ready to play.

02:55.950 --> 02:58.610
Let's save this and refresh make sure it actually looks good.

02:58.730 --> 02:59.150
OK.

02:59.210 --> 03:00.970
Welcome to Gary to play.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.030
And then finally let's add a button.

03:03.030 --> 03:09.420
Remember we had that restart button so I will call a button tagged and then it will have the type button

03:09.840 --> 03:16.120
the name button is fine but let's give it a class and the class for you are going to just reference

03:16.560 --> 03:17.730
bootstrap for this.

03:17.740 --> 03:23.320
So I would expect you to have this memorized I would expect you to reference the documentation but the

03:23.320 --> 03:25.570
class I chose was between.

03:25.780 --> 03:32.170
And then I also added the beats in primary to it and then I wanted to make the button large so I added

03:32.170 --> 03:34.150
between LG.

03:34.150 --> 03:38.290
So basically what's happening here is this class tells it it's a bootstrap button.

03:38.410 --> 03:42.820
This tells it's a primary bootstrap button so that takes care of the coloring and this takes care of

03:42.820 --> 03:44.680
the sizing be at large.

03:44.680 --> 03:45.700
Let me save this.

03:45.760 --> 03:49.370
And let's also add what we want the button say.

03:49.420 --> 03:52.430
So let's have it say something like restart.

03:52.690 --> 03:56.610
Now we could put this on multiple lines if we wanted to keep it all on line.

03:56.630 --> 04:01.490
I'm pretty zoomed in right now but let's refresh and here we have restart.

04:01.660 --> 04:02.430
I can click on it.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.420
Nothing is happening but it's all working the way we want it to.

04:05.440 --> 04:09.110
So for now let's continue on.

04:09.160 --> 04:13.540
Something to think about at this stage is I will probably want to reference this button later on in

04:13.540 --> 04:16.520
my javascript since the only button on the page.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.850
Let's just give it an ID.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.820
We could also call it by its tag but I like calling things by their ID.

04:22.960 --> 04:29.200
So let's give it the ID B so I can call it later and we're going to do is add in the table that's going

04:29.200 --> 04:30.680
to represent our board.

04:30.790 --> 04:34.560
We're going to add in the table and then we'll have to style it to actually make it look like a board.

04:34.840 --> 04:39.850
So let's continue on that we're going to put this inside of the container.

04:39.990 --> 04:42.920
But outside of the Jumbotron.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.000
So let's expand that.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.170
So here we are now inside the container but outside the Jumbotron.

04:49.260 --> 05:03.350
I'm going to call a table and I'm going to say my table has a line equal to center and an inside of

05:03.350 --> 05:03.790
this.

05:03.800 --> 05:09.420
I have three table rows so say TR an inside it be true.

05:09.440 --> 05:13.820
There's going to be three cells so tiddy and we'll leave them blank for now.

05:13.820 --> 05:18.490
See the leave that one blank and then he leave that one blank.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.940
And now let's do this two more times.

05:20.940 --> 05:22.200
You can just copy and paste

05:26.190 --> 05:31.020
and if we save this we should have our table right here.

05:31.150 --> 05:35.280
You'll notice there's actually nothing showing up and that's because we have no styling attached to

05:35.280 --> 05:40.170
this table so let's come over to the CSSA script and actually get some styling.

05:40.320 --> 05:46.290
So we make sure that we're actually seeing this table I'm going to give styling to the actual table

05:46.290 --> 05:55.260
cells the T.D. And let's give it a height of 150 pixels and these values are pretty arbitrary.

05:55.260 --> 06:02.950
So you could have put whatever you want it also give it a width of 150 pixels so they're squares are

06:02.960 --> 06:05.660
going to text align center.

06:05.660 --> 06:12.260
And the reason for that is when I put an X or an O inside of the actual cell I wanted to be center aligned

06:13.850 --> 06:15.250
and then let's give it a border.

06:15.260 --> 06:25.070
This will allow us to see it will say five pixel solid black border and then let's give it a font size

06:25.160 --> 06:26.260
of 100 pixels.

06:26.270 --> 06:30.900
And again this font size refers to what I'm actually going to be putting X's and O's.

06:30.950 --> 06:36.220
So let's save this will refresh over here and now I see my tic tac toe board.

06:36.290 --> 06:40.300
Great and let's practice manually putting in an X over here.

06:40.340 --> 06:43.260
So let's put an X into the very first table cell.

06:43.430 --> 06:49.300
Save this refresh and there's my X and it's text the line centered which is exactly what we wanted.

06:50.300 --> 06:54.760
Great hopefully you're able to get this far with very few difficulties.

06:54.770 --> 06:59.860
I know it may look kind of daunting when you see just what the browser but on the page Tim LNC is a

06:59.860 --> 07:00.260
site.

07:00.260 --> 07:04.070
It's definitely everything that we've done before and it's pretty straightforward.

07:04.840 --> 07:08.830
Now it might not be so straightforward especially since we're just learning it is the actual javascript

07:08.830 --> 07:14.780
code to manipulate the document object model to play the game.

07:14.830 --> 07:16.960
So let's get started on that.

07:17.970 --> 07:20.730
I'm going to have a few sections.

07:21.210 --> 07:22.910
I'll have the restart game button.

07:25.150 --> 07:33.380
Then I'll have some sort of a section that grabs all the squares that I also want some sort of function

07:33.380 --> 07:34.820
that can clear all the squares

07:37.480 --> 07:40.550
and then I want to create a function that will check the square marker.

07:40.570 --> 07:46.350
So something like check the square markers or check if it's an X or no.

07:46.840 --> 07:58.760
And then finally I want some sort of for loop to add event listeners to all the squares.

07:58.860 --> 08:04.520
OK so those are the main task we have to do and our javascript code and I'm going to approach this in

08:04.520 --> 08:05.320
the next lecture.

08:05.330 --> 08:10.310
That way you can spend some time to review the TMLC assess in the next lecture will actually cut out

08:10.340 --> 08:11.490
all the stuff script.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.470
Thanks everyone and I'll see you there.

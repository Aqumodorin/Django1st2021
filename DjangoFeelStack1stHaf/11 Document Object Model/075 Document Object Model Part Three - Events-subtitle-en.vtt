Hello everyone and welcome back to Part 3 document object model events.

00:09.310 --> 00:12.030
Now we're going to learn how to use javascript to trigger on events.

00:13.010 --> 00:17.810
So we don't always want to have to specify beforehand how to interact with the document object model.

00:17.840 --> 00:23.390
It's unrealistic that we're going to be editing the console every single time or that will magically

00:23.390 --> 00:26.800
know in the javascript what we want to actually interact with.

00:26.900 --> 00:32.350
Many times you only want the interaction to occur on a particular event such as a click or a hover.

00:32.360 --> 00:35.430
And that's what you've been used to when you visit real web sites.

00:36.610 --> 00:42.040
Well we all want to do is achieve this sort of effect by adding what's known as an event listener and

00:42.040 --> 00:46.980
the javascript will be listening for an event to occur and then execute a function when it happens.

00:47.020 --> 00:53.160
Let me show you some example code to get a better idea of what I mean by this imagine I want to listen

00:53.160 --> 00:54.480
for an event.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.240
Well the basic form looks like this.

00:56.250 --> 01:01.330
It's my variable whatever variable you happen to have grabbed from the document object model.

01:01.410 --> 01:08.520
Then you say Dot add event listener call that method and then you pass in a particular event and a function.

01:08.520 --> 01:14.370
So for example let's say we grab the head of the document or heading one by saying document that query

01:14.370 --> 01:22.530
selector H-1 then off of that variable we would say add event listener as in an event name and an example

01:22.540 --> 01:27.840
event name is such as click and then comma we would pasand some functions such as the change color function

01:28.110 --> 01:33.860
that we've seen earlier and that's the basic form of event listeners you pass any particular event name.

01:33.990 --> 01:38.940
And then you pass on a function that you've created or a built in function that you want to have happen

01:39.330 --> 01:41.730
upon the event.

01:41.740 --> 01:47.380
So there are many many possible events just a few of them are things such as clicks hovers double clicks

01:47.770 --> 01:49.780
dragging and there's much more.

01:49.780 --> 01:54.570
What I recommend is if you're really interested in all these events then check out this link right here.

01:54.580 --> 02:00.970
You can just google search developer Mozilla javascript events or excuse me document object model events

02:01.000 --> 02:02.500
and I'll probably take you to this page.

02:02.620 --> 02:03.960
But there's the link if you want it.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.270
We're just going to show you a few of the most useful events.

02:07.450 --> 02:12.460
So let's explore these events and then hop over to my editor in browser and show you how you can make

02:12.460 --> 02:16.270
the interaction functions occur upon a particular event.

02:16.540 --> 02:22.190
OK so I have my editor open and I also have a blank HCM file called maned but each team L and then I

02:22.180 --> 02:29.000
also have a blank javascript file called my script that checks and I am going to grab the full path.

02:29.810 --> 02:36.350
Two main HVM L and then go to it in my browser on the right hand side and it's blank right now.

02:36.350 --> 02:38.930
So let's put in some HDMI content.

02:39.140 --> 02:43.450
That way we can in the future grab it using Document object model.

02:43.490 --> 02:48.230
So right now in the body I'm going to add in three H-1 tags.

02:48.230 --> 02:52.590
The first H-1 tag is going to say hover over me.

02:53.630 --> 03:01.460
And we're going to give it an ID equal to 1.

03:01.660 --> 03:12.270
Then the second H1 tag it's going to say click me and we'll give it an ID tag up to and then heading

03:12.270 --> 03:23.140
1 it gets an ID tag you probably guessed it three and it's going to say double click me.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.280
We're going to save that.

03:24.320 --> 03:25.780
Let's refresh our page.

03:26.060 --> 03:33.210
And here we see hover over me click me and double click me and let's connect it using the script tag.

03:33.510 --> 03:39.390
So I will say script and then SIRC the source sequel to my script.

03:39.430 --> 03:47.020
J.S. save that and I'll hop over to my script that G-S and show you how we can add an event listeners.

03:47.310 --> 03:53.000
So the first thing you need to do is actually grab the document object model variables that we want.

03:53.040 --> 04:03.810
So the first one we'll call ahead 1 and I want that to be document dot query selector and then I can

04:03.810 --> 04:10.750
just and hash tag one and I'm going to copy and paste this line since the next two are going to look

04:10.750 --> 04:12.360
really similar.

04:12.400 --> 04:19.840
So instead of one will say the ID 2 and then that of one there will say three.

04:19.900 --> 04:26.360
And then coming all the way over here will change this as well to head 3 and then head to.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.690
So we have everything.

04:28.830 --> 04:30.630
And just to make sure it's all connected.

04:30.660 --> 04:36.550
I'm going to say cancel that log connected.

04:36.660 --> 04:41.410
Let's save this refresh our page and here I see counsel that law connected.

04:41.430 --> 04:43.080
So everything's working well.

04:43.170 --> 04:49.530
I can get rid of this now and let's show you how to add a basic event listener person you need to do

04:49.620 --> 04:58.060
after grabbing from the document object model is grabbed the variable and then you say dots and you

04:58.090 --> 05:04.640
add in events listener and make sure your spelling and capitalization is correct here.

05:04.650 --> 05:13.610
So at event listener and one event you may want to do is what's known as a mouse over and that's essentially

05:13.820 --> 05:21.880
whenever your mouse is hovering over some object or some HMO attribute then the function will take place.

05:21.890 --> 05:26.380
So the key word here is mouse over that Stephen's name.

05:26.540 --> 05:29.460
And then we the function

05:32.720 --> 05:35.350
curly brackets and then hit enter.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.780
And here is where we can define the function.

05:37.780 --> 05:41.660
What do we want to actually happen when we call mouse over.

05:42.070 --> 05:44.860
So let's have the text change.

05:45.040 --> 06:02.440
So I will say head 1 dot text content is equal to mouse currently over.

06:02.610 --> 06:10.910
Let's save that will refresh our page and now you'll notice when I hover my mouse over this one time

06:11.300 --> 06:16.730
it says mouse currently over and then it stops.

06:16.740 --> 06:19.420
So that's the very basic of mouse over.

06:19.680 --> 06:27.390
Let's add one more change to this will also change the color we'll say head 1 style about color and

06:27.390 --> 06:34.300
set that equal to something really obvious like red save it refreshed the page and then I see hover

06:34.300 --> 06:34.940
over me.

06:34.960 --> 06:40.380
And as I come in when I hover over says mouse currently over and then I can't change it back.

06:40.420 --> 06:46.330
So how do we actually make it so that once my mouse comes off of it it reverts back.

06:46.360 --> 06:50.080
Well the way we can do that is with the mouse out events.

06:50.110 --> 07:02.060
So again I grab head one I add an events listener and then I say mouse out pass any function call here.

07:03.000 --> 07:13.060
And for this function call we will have its say head 1 and we will call the text contents of head 1

07:13.060 --> 07:21.440
to be equal to what it originally said and what it originally said was something like over over me.

07:21.660 --> 07:24.590
And then let's change it back to its original color.

07:25.380 --> 07:32.990
And its original color was black OK.

07:33.050 --> 07:35.780
So here we can save this and let's try this again.

07:35.780 --> 07:37.560
And now we should see the change.

07:37.640 --> 07:44.480
If I'm saying mouse currently over I pull my mouse off and it says hover over me and now I can see it

07:44.480 --> 07:47.090
turn on and off as my mouse hovers over it.

07:47.090 --> 07:47.980
So pretty cool.

07:47.980 --> 07:53.050
And you can kind of play around with this a lot but that's the very basics of adding an event listener.

07:53.060 --> 07:58.160
Again you're grabbing something for the document object model probably using a query selector in the

07:58.160 --> 08:03.500
next section we'll learn how to do this with a query and then you say advent listener whatever event

08:03.530 --> 08:09.320
you're looking for you can check out that link for a huge list of event names and then you pass on the

08:09.320 --> 08:09.850
function.

08:09.890 --> 08:14.620
And what you actually want to occur in that function when this event takes place.

08:14.630 --> 08:14.900
All right.

08:14.930 --> 08:16.930
So that's a very basic event listener.

08:17.060 --> 08:27.890
Let's show you some more basic ones such as on Clix or grab head to add an event listener and for a

08:27.890 --> 08:28.330
click.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.930
It's just that keyword click.

08:31.220 --> 08:38.300
Then I will call a function and the function I want here is let's change it upon click.

08:38.300 --> 08:48.660
So I'll say head to teks contents will have its say click Bon and also change its color just so it's

08:48.660 --> 08:49.610
really obvious.

08:49.670 --> 08:58.000
Head to style dot color and I'm going to change that to be blue.

08:58.090 --> 09:04.420
Let's save it refresh over here and right now as I hover over this thing it changes like click on the

09:04.420 --> 09:05.150
click me.

09:05.410 --> 09:07.430
I can see it says clicked on.

09:07.450 --> 09:07.720
All right.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.040
Pretty cool so far.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.210
Finally how we can do a double click.

09:12.100 --> 09:15.210
Head to an event listener.

09:15.280 --> 09:20.340
The key word for this one is DBIL click for double click.

09:20.710 --> 09:28.480
Again we have the function call curly brackets and then whatever you want happens to any really aged

09:28.490 --> 09:31.000
female element on the page will do two loops.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.900
This should actually be had three not had two.

09:33.900 --> 09:44.620
My apologies and then let's change the text content and we'll say I was double clicked

09:48.990 --> 09:50.800
and then will say had 3.

09:51.130 --> 09:58.560
Let's also change the color now all set equal to read save it.

09:58.860 --> 10:03.000
Refresh our page and we can see here my hover is working on a click.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.480
This got clicked on and then if I double click once you can't really see it or hear it.

10:08.520 --> 10:16.000
But I'm only clicking once here it's only until I double click that I see I was double clicked all right

10:16.060 --> 10:21.410
so that's the basics of using events with javascript and the document object model.

10:21.490 --> 10:27.070
Coming up next we're going to be doing a walk through of a very simple game project a very very simple

10:27.340 --> 10:28.480
tic tac toe model.

10:28.480 --> 10:33.430
It's not even going to be a full game of tic tac toe just to get an idea of what all of this would look

10:33.430 --> 10:36.730
like in a larger front and stack project.

10:36.730 --> 10:38.860
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

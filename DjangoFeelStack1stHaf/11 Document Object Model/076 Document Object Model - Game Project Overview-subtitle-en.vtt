Hello everyone and welcome to part for the game project of the document object model section of the

00:09.570 --> 00:10.250
course.

00:11.220 --> 00:16.200
It's time to actually get some practice with the document object model and using javascript to interact

00:16.200 --> 00:17.050
with it.

00:17.130 --> 00:21.990
We're going to be creating a very simple tic tac toe game interface and you have two options on the

00:21.990 --> 00:24.150
approach for this project.

00:24.150 --> 00:29.040
Your first option is to try to replicate the game completely on your own set and this lecture will show

00:29.040 --> 00:33.840
you what the game looks like and you can try to replicate the game on your own in the editor and try

00:33.840 --> 00:34.740
your best.

00:34.740 --> 00:39.490
The second option is to just follow along the solution a lecture that comes after this one for a coatl

00:39.490 --> 00:41.320
long session.

00:41.520 --> 00:46.920
I personally recommend you try at least once completely on your own to get some practice of seeing something

00:46.950 --> 00:48.690
and then trying to replicate it on your own.

00:48.700 --> 00:53.900
That's a really great skill to have but if you're still not that comfortable to material that's no problem.

00:53.940 --> 00:58.890
Feel free to just move on to the solution lecture and have a CO-2 long session until you feel more comfortable

00:59.070 --> 01:01.800
manipulating the document object model.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.460
Let's start by seeing what the final game actually looks like.

01:05.450 --> 01:08.840
OK here we have the game open and this is essentially what it looks like.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.010
You can see him using some bootstrap here for the Jumbotron.

01:12.110 --> 01:17.420
And I have a little button that says restart and all this is it's a table and it's a three by three

01:17.420 --> 01:18.160
table.

01:18.270 --> 01:24.820
But you notice when I actually click on this I see an X and if I click on another square I get an 0

01:24.830 --> 01:25.910
if I click twice.

01:25.970 --> 01:32.630
So it goes x Oh blank and this is a very very simple project so you'll notice if I get three in a row

01:32.720 --> 01:38.360
there's no announcement of any sort of when all I want to focus on here is just manipulating the document

01:38.360 --> 01:39.340
object model.

01:39.380 --> 01:44.570
So it's a very very simple project as far as any logic the only logic that's being done here is that

01:44.570 --> 01:47.860
when you click on something it'll end up cycling through the x.

01:47.970 --> 01:49.470
The Oh and the blank.

01:49.520 --> 01:54.570
And this is just the table with some styling to make it look like a tic tac toe board and then if I

01:54.570 --> 01:58.470
click restart here it just refreshes and clears everything out.

01:58.550 --> 02:00.580
That's all you have to do for the tic tac toe project.

02:00.590 --> 02:05.510
Again I recommend that you least try this completely on your own to replicate something that looks like

02:05.510 --> 02:06.010
this.

02:06.230 --> 02:07.740
Or if you still don't feel comfortable.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.680
Just head on over the next lecture.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.620
We're going to be coding through the solution.

02:11.630 --> 02:13.310
All right thanks everyone.

02:13.310 --> 02:14.000
Best of luck.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.450
I'll see you at the next lecture.

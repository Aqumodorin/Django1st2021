Hello everyone and welcome to the document object model section of the course.

00:09.720 --> 00:15.300
In this section we're going to be learning about the document object model or DCOM Domm and the document

00:15.300 --> 00:20.100
object model is going to allow us to interface our javascript code to directly interactive.

00:20.110 --> 00:22.680
H Tim Allen CSSA on a web page.

00:22.680 --> 00:27.600
So far we've already learned that have a pretty good understanding of the three main front end technologies.

00:27.660 --> 00:33.630
That's simple for the web site content CSSA for the styling of that content and then javascript which

00:33.630 --> 00:38.700
can interact with the Web site each TMLC assess and actually manipulate what you see on the page.

00:38.750 --> 00:43.500
Well we actually don't know how to do yet is how to really connect that javascript with H.M.S. assess

00:43.800 --> 00:48.600
how can we use javascript to directly interact with the H.M.S. assess and change what the user is actually

00:48.600 --> 00:49.190
seeing.

00:50.060 --> 00:55.910
Well browsers will construct the document object model which basically means storing all the HTL tags

00:56.000 --> 00:57.550
as javascript objects.

00:57.730 --> 01:03.020
Let me show you a very simple example of this imagine I have some very basic H-2.

01:03.100 --> 01:08.310
Over here on the left hand side I have a head a title which is just my title in in the body.

01:08.310 --> 01:10.410
I have a heading 1 and then an anchor tag.

01:10.410 --> 01:15.060
Web Site Link and then right below that on the left hand side is what this would look like in the browser

01:15.170 --> 01:18.060
it would just be a heading and then some link text there.

01:18.110 --> 01:23.370
When I upload this in my browser what happens is my browser creates this document object model and I

01:23.370 --> 01:28.500
can already see how this looks like a javascript object so I have the element the aged him l the head

01:28.500 --> 01:35.700
the title the text and I can actually grab things from the document object model using javascript so

01:35.700 --> 01:41.430
we can see the DOMA or dom of any web site so you can go to Web site and in the consul type document

01:41.670 --> 01:43.740
to see the actual document object model.

01:43.740 --> 01:48.510
Now we're going to be doing that in this lecture later on and that will return the text of the page

01:48.990 --> 01:55.950
to see the actual objects you want to use counsel that Diyar and then pasand document this document

01:56.010 --> 02:01.070
object model will allow us to use javascript to actually interact with the web page and affect him and

02:01.130 --> 02:03.070
see us on the web page.

02:03.090 --> 02:05.730
Now keep in mind the document object model is enormous.

02:05.730 --> 02:10.720
It has tons of properties it's a huge object but most developers won't use all the properties.

02:10.740 --> 02:12.460
Not even close to all the properties.

02:12.690 --> 02:17.390
But we're going to be covering the most common objects use and I want you to be prepared for the unknown.

02:17.460 --> 02:22.020
When you first see the docking object model it's going to seem really intimidating and there's all these

02:22.020 --> 02:26.080
properties and you'll feel like there's no way you'll ever have be able to memorize all of them.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.570
And that's not really the point you don't have to memorize all of them.

02:28.590 --> 02:31.820
We have to do is have an understanding of how it works that way.

02:31.860 --> 02:36.300
When you need something that you haven't encountered yet you have the capability to reference it on

02:36.300 --> 02:38.540
your own and look for help on your own.

02:38.550 --> 02:43.440
So let's continue we're actually exploring this idea in the browser and afterwards in the next lecture

02:43.710 --> 02:47.470
we're going to go through an example of using javascript with the document object model.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.840
So let me help over to my browser and kind of show you realistically what the heck I've been talking

02:51.840 --> 02:52.640
about.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.800
OK so here I am at Instagram dot com.

02:55.800 --> 03:00.940
You can really choose any web site for this exercise or this example.

03:01.190 --> 03:06.650
And hopefully now you can kind of see based off just what Instagram looks like at this moment in time.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.310
You probably already have the ability to mockup something that looks pretty similar to this just with

03:11.340 --> 03:13.560
H TMLC SS and bootstrap.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.860
You already know how to create forms how to create nav bars etc..

03:16.860 --> 03:21.270
But let's continue on and talk about the actual thing we came here for which is the document object

03:21.270 --> 03:22.770
model where you can do.

03:22.770 --> 03:23.970
And you can do this on any page.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.240
It has to be Instagram.

03:25.380 --> 03:29.960
Right click then inspect and then come to the console.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.900
And what you're going to do is show us clear the console.

03:32.910 --> 03:37.770
You may have some messages here the website you're visiting but worry about them just clear the console

03:38.160 --> 03:40.640
and let's explore the document object model.

03:40.650 --> 03:47.060
Now if I just type in the variable document and hit enter I will actually get as an output the time

03:47.060 --> 03:53.400
else on this page so I can see here there's a body and I can keep expanding this to end up seeing some

03:53.400 --> 03:56.250
scripts maybe I want to see these divs cetera.

03:56.280 --> 03:59.590
Eventually I'll see the forms but that's not actually what I want to see.

03:59.820 --> 04:06.690
What we want to see is this entire document so all the T.M. and its properties as a javascript object.

04:06.690 --> 04:15.460
And to do that I can say console got DJR and then passen the document I enter and now we see document.

04:15.460 --> 04:22.030
And if I expand it I get what looks like and basically is a javascript object or you have all these

04:22.030 --> 04:24.300
various properties and their values.

04:24.460 --> 04:31.000
And here I can actually then using javascript Rabbe properties from this web page and then edit their

04:31.000 --> 04:35.990
values to actually create changes that appear to the user on the front end.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.160
And that's basically the idea behind the document object model.

04:39.190 --> 04:44.200
This is what's going to allow you to use javascript to actually manipulate what the user sees on the

04:44.200 --> 04:45.110
web page.

04:45.190 --> 04:50.920
And this is going to be the big leap forward for us to end our understanding of how the front end actually

04:50.920 --> 04:51.670
works.

04:51.670 --> 04:56.500
So far we have all the puzzle pieces but we haven't really put them together the document object model

04:56.530 --> 05:01.780
is what's going to allow us to put them all together and actually see how the front end fully collaborates

05:01.780 --> 05:02.750
with javascript.

05:02.770 --> 05:08.950
H.M.S. assess making that powerful front and stack really shine and really work OK.

05:09.070 --> 05:13.360
So that's all I want to cover for this lecture and the next lecture we're actually going to show you

05:13.360 --> 05:19.150
an example of how you can affect this document object model using javascript.

05:19.150 --> 05:21.610
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

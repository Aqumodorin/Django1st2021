Hello everyone and welcome to this quick lecture of a command line crash course being able to navigate

00:11.020 --> 00:16.690
your computer through the command line is a vital skill for any web developer or any general programmer.

00:16.690 --> 00:21.640
Some commands are slightly different depending on if you use a Windows computer or a Mac OS or Linux

00:21.640 --> 00:26.860
computer in this lecture we're going to briefly go over a few of the important commands you should know

00:27.130 --> 00:30.690
and point out any OS differences that you may find yourself facing.

00:30.820 --> 00:35.410
And you could always use the download in notes for reference so there is a folder in the download notes

00:35.410 --> 00:40.660
called command line crash course and everything are going to be talking about is detailed and noted

00:40.660 --> 00:42.330
for you in those notes.

00:42.340 --> 00:47.360
And there's a separate text for Windows computers and a separate text for Mac OS and Linux users.

00:47.500 --> 00:51.330
Mac OS or Linux users share the same set of command lines.

00:51.340 --> 00:54.300
It's only Windows users that are a little different from those two.

00:54.370 --> 00:55.730
Almost all Windows computer right now.

00:55.750 --> 01:01.390
So I'll walk through the windows text file just to show you how it works and I'll make sure to know

01:01.450 --> 01:03.150
any differences that occur.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.350
If you're using a Mac Let's get started.

01:05.350 --> 01:07.560
I'm going to open up my command prompt.

01:08.810 --> 01:13.260
All right so here I am at my command prompt and noticed a free Windows computer.

01:13.260 --> 01:19.430
Your location is usually just told to you here on the left so I can see here that I'm under a user folder.

01:19.590 --> 01:26.880
If I wanted to know all the folders that were under this current directory I could use the d r command

01:26.890 --> 01:32.430
for a Windows computer and that will if a hit enter show me everything that's under that current directory.

01:32.460 --> 01:37.650
So here you can see I have a lot of documents and you also noticed that if they start a dot that means

01:37.650 --> 01:38.910
they're basically hidden.

01:38.940 --> 01:44.000
So if you're looking at this in your finder or your windows viewer you won't find those.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.080
So that's the command for a Windows computer on a Mac OS or a Linux computer.

01:49.080 --> 01:54.760
The command to view all your files in the current directory is LS And that stands for list.

01:55.600 --> 01:59.990
So again L S is for Mac OS and Linux users.

02:00.220 --> 02:03.850
And then Diyar is for Windows users.

02:03.850 --> 02:06.340
Now let's talk about changing directory.

02:06.370 --> 02:09.840
Imagine that I actually want to go to a specific file here.

02:09.850 --> 02:12.220
Let's say I want to go to this video's file.

02:12.220 --> 02:12.910
How do I do that.

02:12.910 --> 02:17.410
Will these commands actually the same whether you are on any operating system like maccaroni operating

02:17.410 --> 02:24.420
system like Windows cetera what you do is you type C which stands for change directory and then you

02:24.420 --> 02:26.440
type in the next directory.

02:26.460 --> 02:30.080
Underneath the directory you're currently are in that you want to go to.

02:30.360 --> 02:36.720
So for example if I want to go to videos I just type CD videos enter and you can see that I have changed

02:36.720 --> 02:38.900
the directory into CD videos.

02:38.910 --> 02:43.710
If I want to go back up a directory again this is the same for both operating systems.

02:43.710 --> 02:51.630
You do see the dot dot and that will take you back up one if you don't quite remember what directory

02:51.690 --> 02:53.820
is you're looking for.

02:53.850 --> 02:58.780
You can just start typing the directory and then use tab to autocomplete.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.850
You keep hitting tab until you find the one you want.

03:01.860 --> 03:07.860
So in this case I won't see the video so I can do that again and we go back with CD and that's how that

03:07.860 --> 03:08.620
works.

03:08.910 --> 03:11.640
OK now let's discuss clearing the screen.

03:11.640 --> 03:13.490
I have a lot of stuff here right now.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.430
This is a little different.

03:14.430 --> 03:15.040
The penny.

03:15.190 --> 03:18.290
You're on a Mac or Windows on a Windows computer.

03:18.310 --> 03:23.670
It's C LS to clear the command prompt on a Mac OS or Linux.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.170
It's clear.

03:25.170 --> 03:33.690
So again C-Class for Windows to clear screen clear free Mac OS or Linux and you can always reference

03:33.690 --> 03:37.030
the notes here if that's easier for you.

03:37.070 --> 03:37.300
All right.

03:37.310 --> 03:40.770
So we learned how to list all the folders in a current directory.

03:40.790 --> 03:46.680
We learned how to clear the screen if you ever want to display your current directory.

03:46.790 --> 03:49.990
You can just look here on the left.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.220
If you're on Windows on a Mac or a Linux computer sometimes it's not so obvious what character you're

03:55.220 --> 03:56.290
currently in.

03:56.300 --> 04:00.980
So you can just type in PWT which stands for print working directory.

04:01.010 --> 04:07.730
Again that's for Mac OS and Linux users in case you want to print out or display your current directory.

04:07.900 --> 04:13.540
If I am on a Windows I can either just look to the left or also just typing CD will also print out my

04:13.540 --> 04:14.300
current directory.

04:14.300 --> 04:18.040
But you can see it's exactly the same as what is or it displayed for me.

04:18.470 --> 04:23.530
OK so now that we learn how to display our current directory We are basically done with everything that

04:23.530 --> 04:26.080
we need it's cover for the command line crash course.

04:26.260 --> 04:30.700
There's also things such as make their victory if you want to make a new folder that's going to be something

04:30.700 --> 04:37.140
like make directory M-K Diyar and that's the same for any operating system.

04:37.240 --> 04:42.460
And then you just say wherever the new directory you want so something like New Folder.

04:42.480 --> 04:46.620
But we're not going to be doing that too often throughout the course and if we ever do touch upon so

04:46.620 --> 04:52.230
command lines that you haven't seen yet I'll be sure to let you know what they are and how we use them.

04:52.270 --> 04:56.150
But right now the only ones you should really be aware of is how to change directory.

04:56.190 --> 05:00.290
The most useful is against CD type in the directory name you're looking for.

05:00.330 --> 05:03.980
For example videos you can use tab to help autocomplete this.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.190
And if you ever want to go back should see the dot dot.

05:07.260 --> 05:09.010
That's really the main one that I wanted to know.

05:09.010 --> 05:12.460
Changing the directory ness the same regardless of your operating system.

05:12.500 --> 05:15.200
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

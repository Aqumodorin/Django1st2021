Hello everyone and welcome to the Spectrum project which is your final project for the CSA sections

00:10.030 --> 00:11.400
of the course.

00:11.470 --> 00:15.340
So for this project you're going to be digitally recreating your own version of the art piece known

00:15.340 --> 00:18.540
as spectrum 5 by an artist known as Ellsworth Kelly.

00:18.840 --> 00:23.110
And it's currently located at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City known as the Met.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.750
Let's take a look at what that art piece actually looks like.

00:25.810 --> 00:27.210
So it looks something like this.

00:27.220 --> 00:32.020
And what we're going to have to do is create your own little web page that has a very similar look to

00:32.020 --> 00:32.250
this.

00:32.260 --> 00:37.480
Basically you'll be creating a set of table cells that have a color and you're going to mess around

00:37.480 --> 00:42.880
with the border the margins and the padding which we learn about the box Model Ss to space those table

00:42.880 --> 00:48.100
cells correctly so that it has some sort of appearance similar to this piece of art.

00:48.140 --> 00:51.440
So you're going to be creating again your own smaller version for the web page using what you've learned

00:51.440 --> 00:55.970
about the box model and you're also going to learn how to pick a color palette to use based off a few

00:55.970 --> 00:57.470
web sites and I'm going to show you now.

00:57.650 --> 01:02.670
Let's take a look at an example of what this project may look like and how to choose a color palette.

01:02.840 --> 01:05.480
I'm going to jump to my browser now.

01:05.480 --> 01:10.850
All right so here I am at my browser and I have a representation of what your final project may look

01:10.850 --> 01:13.210
like it's going to be some sort of variation on this.

01:13.250 --> 01:16.270
And what we have here are essentially table cells.

01:16.270 --> 01:21.130
So here each of these little blocks is a tedious object inside of a table.

01:21.290 --> 01:25.580
And you'll notice that we were able to use the box model to add a little bit of spacing in between them

01:25.580 --> 01:26.820
which is what you're going to do.

01:27.110 --> 01:30.570
And then we also noticed that we have kind of a funky font here.

01:30.650 --> 01:33.170
So your project is going to be the following.

01:33.320 --> 01:38.510
You're going to choose a color palette in a second I'll show you the Web site for choosing a color palette.

01:38.510 --> 01:43.700
Then you're going to assign that color palette to some table cells on your web page and then you're

01:43.700 --> 01:50.090
also going to choose a font either use font library or or Google fonts you're going to connect this

01:50.090 --> 01:50.510
heading.

01:50.540 --> 01:56.240
It can say whatever you want to your new font and you're going to connect the color palette you choose

01:56.240 --> 02:00.790
to these table cells and use the box model to kind of shape and stretch these.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.100
So they look similar to the spectrum of art piece.

02:04.130 --> 02:09.610
So as far as choosing your color palette you can choose color palette at this website.

02:09.620 --> 02:17.090
C o o l o r s Daco or coolers Daco or colors thought the pending how you want to pronounce it.

02:17.090 --> 02:20.290
Basically it's colors of an extra o c o.

02:20.540 --> 02:23.440
And basically this is just a color scheme generator.

02:23.570 --> 02:28.490
If you scroll down here you'll notice that there's already tons of pre-made color schemes so you can

02:28.490 --> 02:33.230
click on View all palettes and it will show you various palettes.

02:33.260 --> 02:35.650
So choose any palette here that you like.

02:35.660 --> 02:42.500
This is just on Explorer but you can click here on best way for it to refresh and it will show you the

02:42.530 --> 02:46.010
most popular color palette that are chosen here.

02:46.010 --> 02:53.630
So for instance this my new palette is the one I chose for this spectrum 5 piece so you just come here.

02:53.810 --> 02:54.970
Click on the palette.

02:55.190 --> 02:59.840
So click on View and it will generate the palette for you.

02:59.860 --> 03:02.670
You don't need to watch the tutorial just exit here.

03:02.740 --> 03:06.090
And here we can see the hex codes for each of these colors.

03:06.190 --> 03:07.260
And those are the hex codes.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.190
You're going to be using for your CSSA file.

03:10.210 --> 03:16.060
So again you just in your age HTML file create this table cells needed to create something that looks

03:16.060 --> 03:16.480
like this.

03:16.480 --> 03:21.940
Again this is just a table with one row and five table cells in it.

03:22.030 --> 03:24.010
And you also choose a font.

03:24.100 --> 03:27.890
If Google fonts using the knowledge we learned about in C S S level 2.

03:27.930 --> 03:35.530
So connect a font of your choice then create the table and connect it to some sort of palette by inserting

03:35.530 --> 03:38.330
these hex codes into your C Ss.

03:38.440 --> 03:38.670
All right.

03:38.680 --> 03:39.520
So that's basically it.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.150
If you have any questions feel free to post them.

03:41.140 --> 03:46.570
That cuniform again you don't need to choose the exact same color palette or the exact same font and

03:46.570 --> 03:49.480
your spacing and padding doesn't have to be exactly the same as mine.

03:49.480 --> 03:56.830
Here just get a general idea of how to incorporate color palettes from that online resource fonts from

03:56.830 --> 04:00.720
Google fonts and the box model per spacing of these table cells.

04:00.730 --> 04:03.680
Those are the three main things I want you to get out of this project.

04:03.890 --> 04:08.590
Choosing a font of your choice incorporating into a web site choosing a color palette being able to

04:08.590 --> 04:14.500
grab those hex codes and incorporate it into your coloring of your site and using the box model to shape

04:14.500 --> 04:16.090
out these table cells.

04:16.090 --> 04:16.750
Okay.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.990
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.460
We're going to cut through an example solution.

04:21.580 --> 04:26.130
Again not every solution to this is going to look the same but just get the general idea.

04:26.260 --> 04:27.190
I'll see you at the next lecture.

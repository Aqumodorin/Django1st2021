00:05.020 --> 00:09.970
Hello everyone and welcome back in this lecture we're going to be going over an example solution to

00:09.970 --> 00:11.480
the Spectrum project.

00:11.530 --> 00:17.410
Remember your solution may not look exactly like mine as far as sizing and color choice but the overall

00:17.410 --> 00:22.690
ideas hopefully similar enough that you can follow along these solutions and reflect back on your own

00:22.690 --> 00:23.500
work.

00:23.500 --> 00:26.090
Let's jump to our editor in browser to get started.

00:26.340 --> 00:26.700
OK.

00:26.710 --> 00:28.810
So here I am with my editor open.

00:28.810 --> 00:32.770
I have two files project thought CSSA and product thought HMO.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.320
They're empty right now.

00:34.330 --> 00:38.770
Here is what we're trying to recreate something that looks similar to this with our own color palette

00:38.770 --> 00:40.980
choice and our own custom font choice.

00:40.990 --> 00:43.940
And right now I have this project thought to.

00:44.050 --> 00:47.320
Just refreshed it so that it's clean and there's nothing there.

00:47.320 --> 00:50.890
Let's get started by working on the Tim elf.

00:50.940 --> 00:56.850
The first thing I'm going to do is just type H T.M. and we'll call the title of this project and we

00:56.850 --> 01:00.540
also want to make sure that it's linked to our actual sheet.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.910
In our case such is called Project that the SS and that's all we have to pass since it's in the same

01:05.910 --> 01:06.920
directory.

01:07.540 --> 01:17.980
And then for the body itself I'm going to give a Heading 1 and we'll call it my spectrum project and

01:17.980 --> 01:20.740
then let's make a table.

01:20.740 --> 01:21.890
So we'll make a table.

01:21.940 --> 01:23.980
It's going to have one table row.

01:24.130 --> 01:28.750
And if we look back at what the solution looks like remember we have one table row with essentially

01:28.750 --> 01:29.820
five cells.

01:30.070 --> 01:37.330
So I would call t d and i will copy and paste that for more times so that my total is five and if I

01:37.330 --> 01:44.050
want to actually reference stuff here it might be useful to give the table a class that I can reference

01:44.050 --> 01:44.440
later.

01:44.440 --> 01:52.750
So let's give it the class something like art and for the table cells let's give them each an individual

01:52.750 --> 01:53.670
ID.

01:53.710 --> 02:00.010
That way I can assign them each individual color and we may not use that class but it's just there in

02:00.010 --> 02:01.760
case we need it later.

02:01.810 --> 02:04.450
The idea is we will definitely use though.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.600
So we'll give each of these our own ID

02:10.940 --> 02:12.200
and we'll label this five.

02:12.200 --> 02:18.020
So let's save that come back to project that each team will refresh and I see my spectrum project.

02:18.170 --> 02:20.480
But the thing is all my table cells are empty.

02:20.480 --> 02:26.690
So let's come to CSX and assign them overall something to make sure that stuff is working.

02:26.930 --> 02:30.980
So let's give them all a background color of black.

02:30.980 --> 02:33.110
And if I refresh this I won't see much.

02:33.200 --> 02:37.380
I see essentially five little tiny cells there you may not even see them on your screen.

02:37.400 --> 02:40.390
So what I have to do is expand the size of these.

02:40.460 --> 02:45.540
So let's continue doing that with something like giving these table cells a height.

02:45.700 --> 02:50.000
Now let's give them a height of 200 pixels with such a colon

02:53.060 --> 02:55.210
save that refresh.

02:55.230 --> 02:57.700
And now you can see there a good height.

02:57.860 --> 03:02.900
All right the next thing I want to do is actually give these table cells a with as well so let's do

03:02.900 --> 03:03.490
that.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.590
Let's give it something like 100 pixels that should be fine.

03:06.590 --> 03:12.620
And then refresh over here in I can see my spectrum project is starting to look similar to what I have

03:12.620 --> 03:12.900
here.

03:12.950 --> 03:17.840
We can measure off the size of the height and the with if we want to make it larger.

03:17.840 --> 03:21.460
So if we want to just expand this a little bit so it's a little nicer.

03:21.470 --> 03:22.820
There we go.

03:23.180 --> 03:31.180
And what I want to do also is start to grab the heading one and text the line to be Center.

03:31.240 --> 03:32.660
Let's refresh this.

03:32.740 --> 03:38.440
And now we're getting to really think of something that looks like closer to a spectrum project.

03:38.440 --> 03:43.530
Something else we noticed here is that the table itself isn't centered.

03:43.630 --> 03:47.270
So let's try to use the margin on auto to do that.

03:47.560 --> 03:53.590
So I can use that class I used earlier or I could also just call table itself since it happens to be

03:53.590 --> 03:54.700
the only table there.

03:55.670 --> 04:04.690
And we'll just call auto save that and now I have a centered margin here or the margin is the outside

04:04.900 --> 04:06.720
the very outside of the box model.

04:07.490 --> 04:08.970
So let's review what we've done.

04:09.140 --> 04:11.520
We've been able to create our table cells.

04:11.870 --> 04:18.090
We have the art class here which allows us to just grab if we go back to the page C.M. that entire table.

04:18.110 --> 04:22.130
So I could have also just called Table but I wanted to be a little more specific in case we have multiple

04:22.130 --> 04:28.460
tables here and use margin auto to center it and have also text the line center that heading 1.

04:28.550 --> 04:30.210
So everything looks good here.

04:30.470 --> 04:35.930
Now what I'm going to do is come to this coolers CO and actually grab some of these hex codes.

04:35.930 --> 04:42.470
I went ahead and just grabbed a basically a random color palette and I'm going to copy and paste these

04:42.470 --> 04:46.010
text codes so let's copy each of these.

04:46.010 --> 04:50.170
So there's my first one there's my second one

04:52.990 --> 04:53.500
third

04:56.440 --> 05:03.740
fourth and let's grab the fifth one and we have to make sure each of these starts with that hash tag.

05:05.960 --> 05:06.930
There we go.

05:07.370 --> 05:11.660
So those are my hex colors and the way I can assign these is by calling the ID's.

05:11.660 --> 05:17.150
Remember we gave each individual table cell in ID and eventually will be able to get rid of this background

05:17.150 --> 05:18.350
color black.

05:18.380 --> 05:19.430
So let's do that.

05:19.700 --> 05:20.500
Let's go.

05:20.510 --> 05:28.200
Hash tag 1 and we'll call the background color for it to be the very first

05:32.100 --> 05:38.880
let's refresh this now we can see we beginning to override some of these the colors because if remember

05:38.880 --> 05:41.070
about CSSA specificity.

05:41.070 --> 05:48.170
The ID is going to be in the hierarchy or above the hierarchy of just a normal element call.

05:48.180 --> 05:53.140
So it's called background color again let's keep doing this for the rest of them.

05:54.440 --> 05:59.310
And if you want you can basically fast forward through this because I'm just repeating myself here.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.820
So let's copy that excuse me

06:08.930 --> 06:14.280
semi colon and we're gonna do that two more times for the for class.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.480
Give it a background color

06:19.270 --> 06:26.570
and let's do that again for five class or five Id excuse me I should have been saying Id not class.

06:26.780 --> 06:28.460
And then let's paste in these colors here

06:31.730 --> 06:34.730
copy and paste that color there.

06:34.760 --> 06:35.100
All right.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.210
So let me save that.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.190
Refresh this.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.390
And now I can see my spectrum project is looking pretty good.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.860
I have the colors lined up and they're overwriting this tiddy call.

06:43.860 --> 06:49.380
In fact I can just delete that save this and I'll still look the same.

06:49.380 --> 06:54.440
Now I want to affect the spacing in between these if we look at Spectrum 5.

06:54.510 --> 06:57.850
There's a little more spacing here in between these actual table cells.

06:57.930 --> 07:04.400
So to do that what I can do is mess around with the box model and remember the important part that box

07:04.400 --> 07:05.750
model is the actual border.

07:05.780 --> 07:10.580
So quick way to do this would just be to get each table cell a white border.

07:10.710 --> 07:19.260
So I'll say something like border and give them each let's say six pixel solid white border.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.990
Save that and refresh.

07:21.180 --> 07:24.780
In here we get the nice spacing out that I was looking for.

07:24.840 --> 07:28.670
And finally I want to add my own custom font to the Heading 1.

07:28.920 --> 07:33.940
So I already have Google fonts opened here and I wanted to just scroll down to a random one.

07:34.290 --> 07:36.230
Let's say something that's.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.100
This one looks nice is Anton.

07:38.220 --> 07:42.330
So we'll add that the family selected will open it up here.

07:42.600 --> 07:53.150
I will copy this as a link into my m l file save it come to project C Ss and copy the font family call

07:54.630 --> 07:57.170
and put it under H-1.

07:57.270 --> 08:02.460
So now when I refresh project I can see my spectrum project now has that new font and that's really

08:02.460 --> 08:04.260
all you have to do for this project.

08:04.320 --> 08:09.680
Again hopefully you have enough practice with the box model so you can play around with this.

08:09.690 --> 08:13.440
You didn't have to do it with the border you could have messed around with the margin and padding as

08:13.440 --> 08:14.970
well but it's really up to you.

08:14.970 --> 08:19.230
There were multiple multiple solutions to getting something to look like this.

08:19.260 --> 08:22.280
So do not worry if your solution did not follow mine exactly.

08:22.290 --> 08:25.650
There are multiple ways to get something that looks like this.

08:25.650 --> 08:29.010
If you have any questions feel free to post them to the Kewney forums.

08:29.160 --> 08:33.900
Hopefully at a fun time recreating something you just saw the front end and you could recreate it using

08:33.930 --> 08:35.760
H TMLC SS on the back.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.500
And thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.

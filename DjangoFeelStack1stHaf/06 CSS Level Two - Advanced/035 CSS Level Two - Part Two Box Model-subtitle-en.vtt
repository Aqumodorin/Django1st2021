Hello everyone and welcome back to part two of the Level 2 this lecture we're going to be discussing

00:11.070 --> 00:17.190
and learning about the CSSA box model the box model allows us to precisely dictate how we want HVM l

00:17.250 --> 00:19.440
elements to look on a page.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.740
So the basic box model looks something like this.

00:21.750 --> 00:27.210
You have your e-mail content that might be something like a paragraph of text within each T.M. then

00:27.300 --> 00:33.450
in-between the paragraph or whatever HVM content you have and the border you have padding and remember

00:33.450 --> 00:38.490
the border is something that actually played with performance C Ss that was things like a two pixel

00:38.490 --> 00:41.110
dotted orange border around your content.

00:41.130 --> 00:45.430
So if you want more space between actual content and the border you have padding there.

00:45.720 --> 00:51.330
And then if you want some space between your border and other HTL content within their own box model

00:51.480 --> 00:54.120
there's a margin you can specify beyond that order.

00:54.150 --> 00:59.650
So each of these padding border and margin elements have a space that you can define.

00:59.670 --> 01:05.220
That way you can space out your elements exactly how you want them to look and you just specify each

01:05.220 --> 01:08.010
side to just beyond padding border and margin.

01:08.010 --> 01:13.710
You can actually specify left the right bottom etc. to have even more flexibility and control over the

01:13.710 --> 01:16.220
box model and your T.M. elements.

01:16.590 --> 01:21.910
Let's explore some examples of this by jumping to our editor in our browser OK.

01:21.910 --> 01:26.050
So here my editor I have an HMO file open called Part Two box models.

01:26.050 --> 01:30.910
It's linked here in my browser and then I also have it linked to a style sheet here that's blank right

01:30.910 --> 01:31.620
now.

01:31.630 --> 01:33.340
Let's add a little bit of content to this.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.120
Tim L5 to get started.

01:35.410 --> 01:44.770
I'll add a Heading 1 elements and it will just be saying something like top and we'll give it the ID

01:45.700 --> 01:57.820
top and then we'll add another Heading 1 and we'll call it bottom with the same ID.

01:57.860 --> 02:04.760
So let's refresh this and see we have a top and bottom and now let's explore what happens when we adjust

02:04.820 --> 02:06.260
the box model around these.

02:06.260 --> 02:11.490
Remember the box small consists of the margin the border the padding and then the actual content.

02:11.510 --> 02:14.120
So to make it clear what's actually going on.

02:14.310 --> 02:21.510
Let's come back to the SS and then create a CSSA call for each of them for each of their IDs.

02:23.660 --> 02:28.860
So that's top and bottom and we'll give each of them a border.

02:29.020 --> 02:34.580
So the border for the first one let's have it be a four pixel solid blue border.

02:35.080 --> 02:45.700
And for the bottom one we'll give it a border of four pixel solid red so save that refresh over here.

02:45.730 --> 02:49.250
Now we can see now we have the actual borders around them.

02:49.390 --> 02:54.610
So something that we can actually specify is the width of the border itself which we've experimented

02:54.610 --> 03:01.870
a little bit by actually color pixels but we can do is the find with as a percentage so we can see right

03:01.870 --> 03:09.100
now that this blue border here goes from essentially one end of the browser to the other.

03:09.100 --> 03:14.350
And if I stretch this browser out as well you'll see that the Border continues to stretch along with

03:14.350 --> 03:19.870
me stress in the browser which is good but sometimes you don't want it to go from ends and you want

03:19.870 --> 03:23.020
to fine it based on some sort of percentage and you can do just that.

03:23.020 --> 03:30.240
So if I want to find the with based off some percentage I can say 25 percent.

03:30.500 --> 03:36.950
Now if I refresh this I can see we're going to tick up 25 percent of the width of the browser.

03:36.950 --> 03:43.250
So as I expand this we can see we're expanding the blue browser as long as it takes up 25 percent of

03:43.250 --> 03:45.210
the width of the actual page itself.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.600
Now let's show you another thing we can do.

03:48.840 --> 03:55.290
We've already seen text align bullets go ahead and show that if I say text the line center and refresh

03:55.310 --> 04:03.570
this page I can see now my text is aligned to the center relative to the actual order.

04:03.570 --> 04:07.200
Now let's imagine that I actually want to move this entire blue block around.

04:07.230 --> 04:13.680
Well what do I have to change then we go back to our box model image which opened up here in a new tab.

04:13.800 --> 04:18.960
We see that it's really the margin that's going to define the space between the border and everything

04:18.960 --> 04:25.530
else so right now if we come back here I have the contents some order and then the margin and in between

04:25.530 --> 04:27.970
the content and the border is padding.

04:27.990 --> 04:31.540
But what we really want to change here is this margin right here.

04:31.590 --> 04:35.690
I want to center this entire blue border.

04:35.890 --> 04:40.590
And one thing we can do is actually specify specifically margin.

04:40.960 --> 04:46.510
And then what I can say is the top right bottom and left pixels.

04:46.540 --> 04:48.100
So we'll start off by showing you the pixels.

04:48.100 --> 04:52.320
What happens if we say something like this 10 pixels on the top.

04:52.360 --> 04:58.360
Let me actually put this as a comment so you can remember the order it goes.

04:58.360 --> 05:02.950
Top right bottom left.

05:02.950 --> 05:08.180
The other way we could do this is by actually specifying something like margined dash left.

05:08.230 --> 05:14.650
So we saw earlier an image that I was pacifically specify left right top bottom but you can just do

05:14.650 --> 05:20.440
it all in one single margin call just by the spacing and there's actually no comma that goes in between.

05:20.440 --> 05:23.950
So we'll have the top 10 pixels margin right.

05:23.960 --> 05:27.470
The 20 pixels and let's say bottom is a lot.

05:27.470 --> 05:34.150
We'll make it 100 pixels and left will make it 400 pixel or something just so we can get an idea of

05:34.150 --> 05:36.420
the differences here and refresh this.

05:36.490 --> 05:42.190
We can see here now we're actually defined in the margin based off of pixels where the width is still

05:42.190 --> 05:45.880
defined to be 25 percent of the actual width of the page.

05:45.880 --> 05:48.130
Now if I call auto here to the margin

05:51.410 --> 05:55.840
save this and refresh notice that it will be auto centered.

05:55.910 --> 06:01.730
So if you want something to be centered not just the textbook the actual block itself that box model

06:02.100 --> 06:07.700
we can see that we can call auto here and right now I'm calling a with of 25 percent of the browser

06:07.700 --> 06:13.590
page and the margin is auto that it's even on both sides.

06:13.630 --> 06:14.270
Great.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.870
Now let's mess around a little bit with this bottom call.

06:18.020 --> 06:25.820
Let's specify that with to be 50 percent of the page and let's give it some padding and remember padding

06:26.210 --> 06:30.710
is going to make space between the actual content and the border itself.

06:31.040 --> 06:36.740
So keep in mind what you think is going to happen if I say something like padding 200 pixels here what

06:36.740 --> 06:41.400
do you expect the shape to look like as far as the relationship between bottom and this red border.

06:41.420 --> 06:42.080
Well let's find out.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.480
Going to refresh.

06:43.790 --> 06:46.160
And this is basically exactly what we hopefully expected.

06:46.160 --> 06:51.620
Remember padding is the difference between the content itself and the border.

06:51.620 --> 06:55.580
So if we come back here we see that we have the content the padding and then the border.

06:55.580 --> 07:02.510
So what do I do if I want to maybe align this to the center while I just come back here and call text

07:02.510 --> 07:06.350
align center refresh.

07:06.560 --> 07:10.930
I can see now my text alignment has been centered.

07:11.100 --> 07:14.900
OK so that is the basics of learning the box model first.

07:14.900 --> 07:22.560
SS Really we just want to focus on those four things the actual content itself the padding the border

07:22.620 --> 07:23.580
and then the margin.

07:23.580 --> 07:29.430
Or remember the spacing that happens between all of them and the fact they can call top left right or

07:29.430 --> 07:33.200
bottom for each of those things OK.

07:33.240 --> 07:39.220
Coming up next is going to be an explanation of a project that will really help hone in on these ideas.

07:39.240 --> 07:43.770
I know we just really briefly covered it in the lecture but the next project is really designed for

07:43.770 --> 07:45.910
you to kind of discover these things on your own.

07:45.990 --> 07:49.980
And then the next section will be discussing Bootstrap which is going to help automate a lot of these

07:49.980 --> 07:55.380
things so you don't have to worry every time by adding a new element what the border is what the with

07:55.380 --> 07:56.770
is what the margin is etc..

07:56.790 --> 08:00.420
A lot of that stuff is going to be taken care of when we begin to use bootstrap.

08:00.430 --> 08:05.340
But for now we want to make sure that you understand if you had to go in and manually edit the assess

08:05.570 --> 08:07.950
that you're able to do that with the box model.

08:07.950 --> 08:13.530
So again box model maintains to get out that if you need to adjust your content you have the padding

08:13.560 --> 08:18.700
border and margin all to play around with to get stuff to look exactly like you want it to.

08:18.800 --> 08:25.240
And you can define things in percent or in pixel and then you can align things to be auto as well.

08:25.530 --> 08:26.940
All right thanks everyone.

08:26.940 --> 08:30.750
I'll see you at the next lecture we're going to explain that project to you and how it's really going

08:30.750 --> 08:35.960
to help you understand the box model and it's also a font aspect to it as well.

08:35.970 --> 08:36.390
Thanks.

08:36.420 --> 08:37.460
I'll see you at the next lecture.

00:05.010 --> 00:07.140
Hello everyone and welcome to part one.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.800
We're going to be discussing tables and set him out.

00:10.820 --> 00:17.360
Tables and HTL consists of several tag's working together and those tags are the general table tag that

00:17.360 --> 00:20.510
lets your age him well know that there's going to be a table here.

00:20.510 --> 00:27.320
Then there's the T head tag which allows you to actually set the first row or the header row of the

00:27.320 --> 00:33.350
table and then inside of that you have th which are the actual elements that we're going to be placing

00:33.680 --> 00:37.440
inside of that header or head row the very top row.

00:37.610 --> 00:43.040
Essentially the name of the columns in the table and then beyond that you have the table rows and then

00:43.040 --> 00:48.320
you have t d for each of the table elements inside corresponding to each column.

00:48.320 --> 00:54.050
Now here I've shown the breakdown with just the opening tags every opening tag would later on have a

00:54.050 --> 00:56.020
corresponding closing tag.

00:56.830 --> 01:01.750
So with that being said let's go ahead and construct the table to understand all of this and get a real

01:01.750 --> 01:04.660
sense of how all these different tags work together.

01:04.870 --> 01:07.440
I'm going to jump to the Adam text editor now.

01:07.450 --> 01:07.720
All right.

01:07.720 --> 01:12.910
Here I am at the Adam text editor and I also have a browser open to the html file I'm working with right

01:12.910 --> 01:15.800
now which is just called tables that age HTML.

01:15.960 --> 01:18.280
You can call your HTML file whatever you want.

01:18.280 --> 01:24.070
Let me just collapse that side directories so it can see the full HTML file a little better the first

01:24.070 --> 01:28.240
time you're going to need is the table type which is basically going to declare that we have a table

01:28.480 --> 01:33.490
and is going to autocomplete that there and everything we're working with is going to go inside these

01:33.490 --> 01:34.710
table tags.

01:34.720 --> 01:40.730
First thing I want to do after that is the table head which is the head.

01:41.240 --> 01:44.440
And this is where your column names are going to go.

01:44.450 --> 01:49.670
So right now if we save this and refresh our Web page we don't see anything because we really don't

01:49.670 --> 01:51.740
have any content in the table yet.

01:52.010 --> 01:57.640
But as I put a th which is basically the actual content that goes to the table head.

01:57.810 --> 02:00.070
Wolves do something like a number.

02:00.170 --> 02:04.400
Now my table will show something and here it is just a number.

02:04.400 --> 02:11.360
Now let's add a couple more th elements are th tags for something like color and then let's add another

02:11.360 --> 02:11.780
one.

02:11.780 --> 02:12.750
Th.

02:13.250 --> 02:20.870
And we'll do country saved that refresh over here and now we have number color country and note how

02:20.870 --> 02:25.910
there a line there are lines as if they are the titles of the column names that are going to be coming

02:25.910 --> 02:26.320
up.

02:26.570 --> 02:29.730
So then the question is how do we actually add rose to the table.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.150
And then how do we actually add table cells.

02:32.670 --> 02:40.480
Well outside of this T head we say TR And that's going to stand for a table row and now we can do is

02:40.490 --> 02:44.700
inside of this table row put in tiddy for our table cells.

02:44.760 --> 02:50.670
So let's start off with a number and that corresponds with the first column which is the number column.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.180
Let's put in the next cell.

02:52.380 --> 02:56.150
And this is in the first row that first TR And now we need a color.

02:56.160 --> 03:01.550
Let's put in something like red and Alice put in a country.

03:01.570 --> 03:06.070
Let's just say USA will save this and refresh.

03:06.370 --> 03:08.810
And now we can see that we're actually starting to construct the table.

03:08.830 --> 03:10.090
Let me zoom in on this.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.370
It's a little more clear.

03:11.740 --> 03:11.980
OK.

03:11.980 --> 03:14.260
So we can see we're actually constructing a table.

03:14.290 --> 03:19.810
A lot of times you want your table to actually have a border and we'll be discussing styling tables

03:19.810 --> 03:25.290
a lot more or we talk about CSSA SS But a quick way to do it is in this table 10.

03:25.410 --> 03:31.500
Just do a space and add in border and Adam text editor is actually going to help you out here.

03:31.560 --> 03:36.990
And if you just hit enter here automatically thought border for you and then just pasan a number like

03:36.990 --> 03:38.060
one.

03:38.100 --> 03:43.460
And then when you refreshed this after passing that number in you get to see this auto border created.

03:43.620 --> 03:48.160
And like I mentioned there's a lot more styling can do instead of getting like such an ugly border for

03:48.160 --> 03:48.630
a table.

03:48.630 --> 03:52.600
But right now so help us differentiate rows and columns.

03:52.900 --> 03:53.360
OK.

03:53.550 --> 03:55.840
Let's practice adding in one more row.

03:56.370 --> 04:01.580
Again it's TR for the table row and then tiddy for the table cell.

04:01.910 --> 04:04.820
Now let's see what happens if we just add in one table cell values.

04:04.840 --> 04:09.180
I just put in 100 and I click save and refresh here.

04:09.330 --> 04:11.960
Note that I still get that 100 values.

04:11.970 --> 04:17.010
So I can still add in values and basically have blank values for certain columns.

04:17.010 --> 04:21.090
Now it's always suggested they try to fill out your table completely but just keep that in mind that

04:21.090 --> 04:23.340
your table will still be able to generate.

04:23.400 --> 04:29.700
There won't be an error thrown at all if you only have one corresponding value for your row.

04:30.180 --> 04:31.500
So let's fill that in.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.370
Next what you want is a color.

04:33.530 --> 04:41.400
Let's just say blue chips and let's put in one more which is going to be a country unless you say France

04:42.070 --> 04:47.000
I'm going to save that and let's refresh and there we have it one more row.

04:47.280 --> 04:47.850
OK.

04:47.910 --> 04:51.110
And that's really all there is to creating tables in him.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.240
It's pretty straightforward.

04:52.350 --> 04:54.180
Let's just quickly review the steps.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.810
Everything we've done goes inside these table type.

04:56.820 --> 04:59.190
We have an opening one and a closing one.

04:59.190 --> 05:03.940
And then if you want to have a border here you can just say Borders equal to and then it quotes Harry

05:03.970 --> 05:05.010
put in one.

05:05.130 --> 05:10.770
If we put in larger numbers such as five basically what's going to happen is you will get a thicker

05:10.770 --> 05:11.550
border.

05:11.550 --> 05:18.240
Now I'm zoomed in here so the effect is a little more pronounced but let's make it really large say

05:18.240 --> 05:23.980
50 and then refresh and see if we get a extremely thick border on the outside.

05:24.150 --> 05:27.490
So you may be wondering well how do I actually edit these borders on the inside.

05:27.540 --> 05:30.940
That's something we're going to discuss a lot more in the CSA section of the course.

05:31.010 --> 05:32.630
Right now you can just put in one.

05:32.730 --> 05:38.500
And that should make things clear enough as far as what's a row and what's a column OK.

05:38.570 --> 05:44.570
Then after that we have the T head section and a t head section is differentiated from the TR section

05:44.860 --> 05:47.160
in the sense that it's actually just the column name.

05:47.160 --> 05:54.050
So it represents and it's in bold versus just regular text so we see number color country you can call

05:54.050 --> 05:59.170
these sort of rewashed that basically defines how many columns your table is going to have.

05:59.210 --> 06:05.170
Now if we remove this t head let me just cut that out save this and refresh.

06:05.210 --> 06:06.800
You still get a table just fine.

06:06.860 --> 06:11.760
So don't want to give the impression that every table requires a head tag.

06:11.900 --> 06:14.000
You can build a table without the head.

06:14.060 --> 06:15.880
So that's totally fine.

06:15.890 --> 06:22.190
But you should try to at least for a viewer sake keep in mind is it readable without the T head.

06:22.370 --> 06:26.380
And here I have put in the T head back in and for the head.

06:26.480 --> 06:35.090
Those elements are under the th tag then everything else is a T R for t row the table row and then each

06:35.090 --> 06:37.840
table cell inside of those rows is just Tiddy.

06:37.870 --> 06:40.900
And you have to place them in the order that the columns come in.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.250
Which is why we choose t head.

06:43.340 --> 06:48.340
So we can always make sure we have a reference that corresponds to the actual order of the elements.

06:48.340 --> 06:50.120
All right that's basically it.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.040
Thanks everyone and I will see you in the next lecture.

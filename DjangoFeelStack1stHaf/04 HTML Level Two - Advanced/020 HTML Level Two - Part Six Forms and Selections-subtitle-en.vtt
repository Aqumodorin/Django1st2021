Hello everyone and welcome back to part six form selections in this lecture we're going to continue

00:10.960 --> 00:14.350
exploring the variety of input methods for each time forms.

00:14.500 --> 00:19.460
And those are going to be things such as a single radio button how to link multiple radio buttons dropdown

00:19.510 --> 00:22.050
menus and then text area inputs.

00:22.150 --> 00:27.270
Coming up next after this lecture will be an assessment exercise so we can fully understand everything

00:27.270 --> 00:32.690
it has to do with him all forms and that will end our H-2 him all sections of the course.

00:32.800 --> 00:37.630
But before you reach the next assessment let's get some quick practice with these various input methods.

00:37.630 --> 00:37.930
All right.

00:37.930 --> 00:43.100
So here I have a normal age team I'll file open and it's linked to my browser just called forms.

00:43.150 --> 00:44.110
H Tim L.

00:44.320 --> 00:49.540
And you can see here I've set the tile to hotel feedback so we now know enough HVM that we can try to

00:49.540 --> 00:51.900
mimic more of a real world situation.

00:51.910 --> 00:57.040
For instance let's say you've stayed in a hotel afterwards that may send you an email to a link asking

00:57.040 --> 00:57.930
for some feedback.

00:57.940 --> 01:02.890
So we're going to try to mimic what that feedback page would look like and to do this let's just start

01:02.890 --> 01:07.950
with a heading that says something like hotel feedback form.

01:07.950 --> 01:09.880
Save this refresh over here.

01:10.050 --> 01:11.550
Looks like it's linked correctly.

01:11.550 --> 01:12.280
Great.

01:12.300 --> 01:14.420
Now let's start with our form.

01:14.690 --> 01:19.100
And if you just auto create form you'll have class action method etc..

01:19.110 --> 01:20.690
Right now we don't really need that.

01:20.730 --> 01:27.070
If you want you can set method to just be get right now as I mentioned earlier we're going to be covering

01:27.130 --> 01:29.880
what and post is much more in the future.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.520
Right now you can just leave it as you see here.

01:32.530 --> 01:36.100
First thing I want to do is understand how radio buttons work.

01:36.130 --> 01:42.550
So for instance do you just type an input and and type instead of text you pass in radio.

01:42.850 --> 01:48.130
You can save this refresh and you see a little radio button pop up here and if I click it I can see

01:48.130 --> 01:49.170
it it got filled in.

01:49.340 --> 01:54.280
Right now if I try to click it again nothing changes I can't click it on and off it's just clicking

01:54.340 --> 01:55.350
once.

01:55.420 --> 02:00.100
So let's try to expand on this concept by actually asking a question here.

02:00.100 --> 02:05.040
So in a header or heading 3 I'm going to say this.

02:05.110 --> 02:16.580
Are you from inside the US or outside the US so may we have international travelers and we want to know

02:16.590 --> 02:20.940
do they come from the United States or outside the United States if this hotel is in the United States

02:20.940 --> 02:30.060
or somewhere internationally and then we'll have an input as a radio button and we will label this radio

02:30.090 --> 02:34.270
button and let's review how we can label using that for method.

02:34.440 --> 02:36.300
So I can say something like for

02:38.880 --> 02:49.890
us and then give this particular radio button an ID of an let's say in USA.

02:50.130 --> 02:53.190
So let's save that in this label.

02:53.190 --> 03:02.000
I'm going to say something like inside say that refresh and he see are you from inside the US or outside

03:02.000 --> 03:06.880
the US in the right now I can just highlight the only option available inside and I can only highlight

03:06.880 --> 03:08.730
it on a can't change anything about it.

03:08.870 --> 03:20.230
So let's make another one we'll make another label we'll call this for how USA now we will call this

03:20.380 --> 03:30.850
outside and then create another and put we'll make another radio button type and give it the ID to match

03:30.850 --> 03:35.190
that label which in our case is out USA.

03:35.590 --> 03:39.740
We will save this refresh and now we see we have a hotel feedback form.

03:39.750 --> 03:42.120
We have two options inside or outside.

03:42.270 --> 03:43.880
Right now we have a little bit of a problem.

03:43.900 --> 03:50.430
I can actually highlight inside highlight outside and that's it that's all I can do right now.

03:50.500 --> 03:56.710
What I would really like to do is to link these two radio buttons together so that if I click inside

03:56.800 --> 04:02.200
than outside cannot be selected or if I click outside then inside cannot be selected so I want to be

04:02.200 --> 04:07.750
able to turn these on and off in respect to each other and the way you do that is you give them the

04:07.750 --> 04:11.080
same name and that's where this name comes into play.

04:11.080 --> 04:16.220
So let's give this first radio button a name Alosi for location.

04:16.510 --> 04:19.770
And let's give the second one the same name Alosi.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.730
Now let's save this refresh.

04:23.100 --> 04:29.500
And we notice if I click inside it's highlighted by click outside inside becomes highlighted so we can

04:29.500 --> 04:34.540
see now that they're linked because they share the same name and that makes sense because given what

04:34.540 --> 04:38.770
we know about names and the assignment we'll have to assign something to that name.

04:38.770 --> 04:44.300
In this case we can only assign one of these to either be inside or outside.

04:44.410 --> 04:47.820
And that's how you link radio buttons together you just give them the same name.

04:47.830 --> 04:52.110
They can have different labels but if you want to link them together you just give them the same name.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.100
All right let's start exploring another type of input here.

04:56.100 --> 05:03.310
And this one is going to be let's say Well asks How was your service.

05:03.470 --> 05:07.790
So how was your service.

05:09.420 --> 05:10.020
Save that.

05:10.020 --> 05:11.220
Make sure it worked.

05:11.250 --> 05:11.480
All right.

05:11.490 --> 05:16.620
How was your service and let's actually make this better to instead of just the paragraphs that kind

05:16.620 --> 05:19.110
of matches along with the other one.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.810
And let's make this other one too.

05:20.820 --> 05:27.460
So it's not so big a head or two over here as well each to save that refresh over here.

05:27.480 --> 05:27.960
So are you.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.560
From inside us outside that's linked together.

05:30.660 --> 05:32.460
How was your service for the service.

05:32.460 --> 05:39.630
Well we're going to do is explore a dropdown menu and the way dropdown menu works is not with the input

05:39.630 --> 05:44.050
tag but with the select tag and the select.

05:44.070 --> 05:45.590
It works like this.

05:45.590 --> 05:50.000
You say select you can give it a class right now.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.990
That doesn't make sense for us because we haven't learned about C Ss So we'll come back to that later

05:54.800 --> 05:55.730
and we can give it a name.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.830
So let's give this the name stars.

05:58.100 --> 06:06.380
So we want a drop down menu of how many stars and what we can do is give an option and then this option

06:06.560 --> 06:07.560
has a value.

06:07.580 --> 06:15.710
So let's give a value of great and in-between these option tags is going to be in actual numbers so

06:15.710 --> 06:16.790
we'll say three.

06:16.820 --> 06:19.540
Let's save this and see what this looks like so far.

06:19.550 --> 06:23.770
So here we have the dropdown three in so far.

06:23.790 --> 06:25.170
That's it.

06:25.170 --> 06:29.550
So let's create a couple of more options for the stropped on menu and then we can break down what value

06:29.610 --> 06:33.590
is so going to make another value that just says OK.

06:34.490 --> 06:42.880
That's too and then let's make one more option and we will say this is bad.

06:43.830 --> 06:46.050
And it was one star.

06:46.050 --> 06:50.140
So now if I save this I have my select which in the case a dropdown menu.

06:50.250 --> 06:55.650
I've given a name to my select and I have various options here with what happens in between the option

06:55.650 --> 06:58.490
tags is what's actually displayed to the user.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.930
But behind the scenes they can have their own values.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.660
So let's refresh this.

07:02.810 --> 07:08.310
And now that we say how is your service I see the dropdown gives me three two or one that I can choose

07:08.310 --> 07:09.920
from.

07:10.220 --> 07:15.280
So let's add a submit button to this so we can see what happens when it hit submit.

07:16.120 --> 07:23.020
So outside of this but inside the form I'm going to create a submit button and give it a value called

07:24.110 --> 07:25.040
submit.

07:25.220 --> 07:31.440
Save that and refresh and let's pay attention to what happens to the url after I hit submit.

07:31.490 --> 07:35.910
All Sam from inside the U.S. and my service was too.

07:35.960 --> 07:40.810
So now that I've clicked submit we see here in the URL I have ellos is equal to.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.220
And right now it's actually blank.

07:42.260 --> 07:42.790
And then it says.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.260
And stars is equal to.

07:45.260 --> 07:46.070
OK.

07:46.640 --> 07:53.210
So what I want to do is back in these radio Open's actually fill in a value here that corresponds to

07:53.210 --> 07:54.030
the radio button.

07:54.050 --> 08:01.800
So I will set the value for inside or the inside radio button and set the value here for outside.

08:01.890 --> 08:07.980
Let's save this and refresh and let's actually delete these values here.

08:07.980 --> 08:10.940
Go back to the forums page refresh this.

08:10.980 --> 08:12.160
And now let's try again.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.050
We'll say Hotel feedback form.

08:14.130 --> 08:15.060
Are you from inside.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.530
We'll say we're from inside.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.460
How's the service.

08:17.460 --> 08:21.350
We'll give it one star and notice here.

08:21.380 --> 08:26.670
Now I have corresponding values in both the dropdown menu and the radio buttons.

08:26.690 --> 08:33.110
So if I click Submit now I can see here the your L that my ellos see the name is equal to the value

08:33.370 --> 08:33.850
inside.

08:33.860 --> 08:37.430
Since I chose inside and stars is equal to the value here.

08:37.430 --> 08:38.200
Bad.

08:38.330 --> 08:44.270
And that's a really nice way that you can have your own value names on your back ends but show something

08:44.330 --> 08:46.490
else on the front end.

08:46.640 --> 08:51.830
So notice that the front end here is wishing for the dropdown menu was three to one but on the back

08:51.860 --> 08:57.830
and I had these set values great Ok bad well might be more realistic is if you actually set values on

08:57.940 --> 08:59.960
two numerical values three to one.

08:59.990 --> 09:01.310
And then here the options are great.

09:01.310 --> 09:02.290
OK bad.

09:02.300 --> 09:05.160
And then you can maybe take mathematical averages.

09:05.360 --> 09:10.100
Behind the scenes that we can learn a lot more about back and stuff later on this course hopefully you

09:10.100 --> 09:12.560
get an idea now of what's possible.

09:12.560 --> 09:16.580
Finally I want to add one more type of input that we want to check out.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.660
And that's the text area.

09:18.820 --> 09:22.290
So I'm going to put a paragraph here and we'll have a question that says something like.

09:22.310 --> 09:26.510
Any other feedback you want to give as a paragraph.

09:26.510 --> 09:28.620
Let's actually make that a head or two.

09:28.850 --> 09:31.060
Way it's the same size everything else.

09:31.250 --> 09:34.480
And we so far have learned about the text input.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.800
In fact it's the default.

09:35.900 --> 09:40.030
So if I click save here refresh I see any other feedback.

09:40.040 --> 09:44.240
But usually you don't want the user to just type everything in one single line.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.520
You want an actual box text area.

09:46.520 --> 09:52.580
So the way we can do that is instead of text where you can say text area and that actually creates its

09:52.580 --> 09:54.170
own text area tag.

09:54.170 --> 09:56.510
So I will delete this

10:00.230 --> 10:02.790
and say text area.

10:02.960 --> 10:09.140
We can give that a name so we can just use the default here or we can say my text and you give it a

10:09.140 --> 10:13.050
number of rows and a number of columns you want it to expands.

10:13.100 --> 10:17.390
So let's save this now refresh and see here.

10:17.390 --> 10:21.430
Now I have my text area so hello this is my text area.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.120
And now we have multiple lines so we can start typing stuff in.

10:24.290 --> 10:29.120
And we're going to learn more about text areas right now because it's a little different than taking

10:29.120 --> 10:32.980
in a single value because you have whole blocks of text.

10:33.080 --> 10:37.340
But I just want you to be aware they have a text area here at your disposal.

10:37.340 --> 10:41.690
All right so that's it for the various types of inputs we wanted to cover here under form selections.

10:41.690 --> 10:42.840
Let's do a quick review.

10:42.980 --> 10:44.360
Let me expand this.

10:44.360 --> 10:49.460
We've covered how to do radio buttons remember that just input and the type is radio.

10:49.550 --> 10:53.720
And if you want to link radio buttons together you make sure the group of radio buttons just has the

10:53.720 --> 10:58.760
same name and you can assign values to them so that when you click submit you can get those values back

10:59.360 --> 11:00.930
then for a dropdown menu.

11:00.940 --> 11:07.670
Use the select tag with options and you can then again assign values and the values don't have to match

11:07.670 --> 11:11.360
up what the user actually sees as their dropdown options.

11:11.540 --> 11:17.450
And then finally we learned about the text area which allows you to basically make a block for a text

11:17.510 --> 11:17.990
area.

11:17.990 --> 11:21.710
And if we come back here to the browser you can see that we can actually kind of play around with this

11:21.770 --> 11:22.230
a little bit.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.210
As far as how far down it can go.

11:25.220 --> 11:28.740
And then finally we have the submit button that we've covered before.

11:28.760 --> 11:29.360
All right.

11:29.360 --> 11:33.710
Coming up next is an assessment exercise so you can get a lot of practice if everything you've covered

11:33.770 --> 11:34.400
in the section.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.150
Of course.

11:35.150 --> 11:36.860
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

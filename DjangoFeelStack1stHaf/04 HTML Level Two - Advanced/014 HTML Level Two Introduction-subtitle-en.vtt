Hello everyone and welcome to h tim at level 2.

00:08.900 --> 00:13.520
We finally reached the level of a small section of the course and this section of the Course is really

00:13.520 --> 00:16.470
going to focus on two topics tables and forms.

00:16.610 --> 00:22.310
And overall it's going to consist of a lecture on tables then a table quiz basically allowing you to

00:22.310 --> 00:24.400
practice tables T.M..

00:24.500 --> 00:27.520
Then we'll talk about how to use forms with h t m l.

00:27.640 --> 00:33.450
And finally have an assessment test at the end where you get to practice using forms with the Tamil.

00:33.660 --> 00:39.090
Once we finish this section of course we're going to be ready to dive into CSSA to start styling each

00:39.170 --> 00:45.420
T.M. and a quick note will h tim l may seem pretty basic and possibly boring at sometimes at first we

00:45.420 --> 00:48.790
really needed to build a good foundation for our knowledge later on.

00:48.790 --> 00:52.710
So you can think of this section almost as eating your vegetables before you get to go onto the main

00:52.710 --> 00:58.750
course and then later on dessert OK let's go ahead and get started by talking about tables.

00:58.790 --> 00:59.970
I'll see at the next lecture.

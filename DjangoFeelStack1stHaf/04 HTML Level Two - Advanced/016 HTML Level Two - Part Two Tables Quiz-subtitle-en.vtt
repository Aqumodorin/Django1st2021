Welcome back everybody.

00:06.050 --> 00:08.230
To part two tables quiz.

00:08.600 --> 00:13.750
So you've actually learned enough in the previous lecture to get some practice creating your own tables.

00:13.790 --> 00:20.210
I want you to open the TXI tea or textfile inside of the HMO level 2 folder called part to underscore

00:20.210 --> 00:25.640
table underscore quiz Dot T x t and there are some instructions there that we're going to be exploring

00:25.640 --> 00:26.050
right now.

00:26.060 --> 00:30.740
But basically for this exercise you're going to be recreating a table based off the information provided

00:30.740 --> 00:31.830
in that text file.

00:31.880 --> 00:36.020
Let's take a quick look at that text file and then show you an example of what the end result will look

00:36.020 --> 00:36.690
like.

00:36.710 --> 00:39.080
I'm going to jump to the Adam text editor now.

00:39.080 --> 00:44.120
All right so I opened up that table quiz thought textfile here and basically we're going to be doing

00:44.120 --> 00:47.680
is using the following information to make a table about country GDP.

00:47.680 --> 00:51.560
And it says pop quiz here but I kind of warned you about this already so it's not really a totally pop

00:51.560 --> 00:57.590
quiz all the source for this data is from this wikipedia link on the list of countries by GDP and what

00:57.590 --> 01:02.870
it wants you to do is make a table of a team consisting of three main columns the country name or country

01:02.870 --> 01:03.420
flags.

01:03.450 --> 01:09.680
Will be an image and then GDP in millions of U.S. dollars and your table will have three rows and you'll

01:09.680 --> 01:13.010
use the information below to attribute it to the cells correctly.

01:13.010 --> 01:16.040
So you have United States as the first countries name.

01:16.040 --> 01:21.010
You have a link for the U.S. flags you can see here I have the Wikipedia link to an image of that flag.

01:21.050 --> 01:24.480
And then the actual number for GDP which is here 18 million.

01:24.770 --> 01:30.830
If I succeed 1930 then we have India and I'll have the Indian flag as a link there.

01:30.860 --> 01:32.400
And then their GDP.

01:32.510 --> 01:35.900
And then we have the United Kingdom the U.K. flag which has a link here.

01:35.900 --> 01:41.300
And then there are GDP from issue very quickly what the final result you'll be creating actually looks

01:41.300 --> 01:41.710
like.

01:41.780 --> 01:45.230
And here have opened what the basic final result will look like.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.660
Notice that I've created a border.

01:46.670 --> 01:51.120
We have those three columns of country name country flag GDP and millions of U.S. dollars.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.930
And then we have those three rows and that's basically all there is to it.

01:54.950 --> 01:59.300
As far as what you're going to be creating So try your best just based off of this text file and the

01:59.300 --> 02:04.900
information here to open up a brand new HVM l file and recreate this table that looks like this.

02:04.900 --> 02:10.250
So three rows three columns the a little bit of a tricky part that we haven't shown yet is how to actually

02:10.310 --> 02:14.930
insert an image here but it shouldn't be too different than what we've done before.

02:14.930 --> 02:18.290
In fact you should already know how to do it based on everything we've covered.

02:18.290 --> 02:21.790
So definitely take your time explore reference Google if you need it.

02:21.800 --> 02:26.090
But coming up next is going to be the walk through solutions to this exercise.

02:26.090 --> 02:27.900
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

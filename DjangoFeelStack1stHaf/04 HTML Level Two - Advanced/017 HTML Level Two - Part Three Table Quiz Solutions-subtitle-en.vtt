Hello everyone and welcome to three tables quiz solution.

00:08.770 --> 00:13.030
In this lecture we're just going to be coding through the solutions for the table quiz.

00:13.210 --> 00:14.590
Let's get started.

00:14.590 --> 00:20.140
All right so I have my text editor opened and I have my browser open to this tables that HVM l file

00:20.140 --> 00:25.040
which is currently blank let me collapse that directory screen.

00:25.120 --> 00:31.150
And here I have the actual text file with the quizz instruction so I can reference this data later on

00:31.370 --> 00:35.490
or remember you want to just create a table with those three columns and three rows.

00:35.590 --> 00:38.440
Let's start off by just creating the ditched him file itself.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.230
Well luckily we just have to type H.T..

00:40.240 --> 00:44.080
Hit enter and everything's automatically created there for us.

00:44.080 --> 00:51.090
And then here in the body I'm going to just say something like table and let's insert a header just

00:51.090 --> 00:57.990
to make sure we're properly lnk are heading I should say and we'll say table quiz save that.

00:57.990 --> 00:59.130
Let's refresh this.

00:59.130 --> 01:00.350
And here we see table quiz.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.120
So we know these are linked together so we're good to go.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.030
I can just delete that heading now since I know it's linked.

01:06.030 --> 01:07.920
And now I have the table.

01:07.920 --> 01:12.020
The first thing of this table that I want to create is the T head element.

01:12.030 --> 01:16.610
I remember the T head or the table head is what actually has the column names.

01:16.620 --> 01:18.730
So it has the column names in bold there.

01:18.840 --> 01:23.410
And that takes in th cells instead of the regular T-cells.

01:23.990 --> 01:27.270
In my first column will be the country name.

01:27.360 --> 01:38.090
My second column will be the country flag and then my third column remember is the GDP in millions of

01:38.090 --> 01:39.490
U.S. dollars.

01:39.530 --> 01:44.210
So let's save that and make sure it actually worked for us by refreshing over here and there we have

01:44.210 --> 01:46.190
a country named country flag GDP.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.500
Millions of U.S. dollars.

01:47.750 --> 01:51.930
But remember that the actual solutions that looked like it had a border to it.

01:52.040 --> 01:57.890
And we covered how to create a border back in the tables lecture you just come up here to tables select

01:57.890 --> 02:05.460
border equal to English just put in let's say to then we refresh and now we have that nice border.

02:05.590 --> 02:07.990
Now it's just a matter of filling in the information.

02:07.990 --> 02:12.760
So the information we have has to go under table rows or Tiaras tags.

02:12.790 --> 02:14.070
So here's a table row.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.880
Now let's start by filling in the first table cells.

02:18.070 --> 02:20.570
So the first one we have is USA.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.350
That's the first table cell.

02:22.480 --> 02:28.080
Then the second one we have Tedi is going to be the actual image of the flag.

02:28.330 --> 02:30.720
In order to put that in we need to call an image tag.

02:30.730 --> 02:35.620
So we didn't actually show this in the table lecture but all you have to do is just type an image and

02:35.620 --> 02:36.690
then put in the source.

02:36.690 --> 02:41.950
So we have this image tag that we worked with earlier and it just nested inside this CD or table cell

02:41.950 --> 02:42.360
tag.

02:42.480 --> 02:48.160
And that's really all you had to do for that let's grab that USA flag link so I will copy and paste

02:48.160 --> 02:49.050
it from here.

02:50.630 --> 02:58.950
Let me copy that and then paste it inside the source save this and let me refresh to make sure everything

02:58.950 --> 03:04.950
worked correctly here and there we have country flag and us so we're linked correctly.

03:04.950 --> 03:11.010
And then finally the last cell I want for this row is with my tv tags here.

03:11.020 --> 03:15.280
They will cell call it and let me zoom in a little bit so we can see a little better.

03:15.510 --> 03:17.900
It's the GDP in millions of U.S. dollars.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.780
And from the notes just right here 18 million 561 etc..

03:23.790 --> 03:25.850
So let's pay that in.

03:26.070 --> 03:27.660
Save it refresh.

03:27.670 --> 03:28.740
And it looks like we're good to go.

03:28.740 --> 03:32.520
Here we have the country named country flag and GDP.

03:32.520 --> 03:36.500
Now just a matter of duplicating this process for the next two rows.

03:36.510 --> 03:40.560
So again we just say table row and let's just put in the three cells right now.

03:40.700 --> 03:51.350
DD see the the and the next one we had was India and then I'm going to put in the image tag again.

03:51.420 --> 03:57.690
I M.G. enter and automatically has the S R C or the source for you and we will grab this Indian flag

03:58.290 --> 03:59.900
from Wikipedia and a quick note.

03:59.910 --> 04:05.300
Sometimes Wikipedia will change the actual links or the size of the picture.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.140
So we're getting some distortion the size.

04:07.140 --> 04:12.300
Don't worry we're going to cover how to actually set image sizes later on especially during the CSSA

04:12.300 --> 04:13.030
lectures.

04:13.050 --> 04:16.440
So if you get kind of funky flag sizes don't worry about it too much.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.800
Just make sure you understand the idea of creating the table itself.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.900
Don't worry too much about these actual links.

04:21.900 --> 04:24.790
In fact you can replace it with your own links if you want it to.

04:24.870 --> 04:31.740
So I will just copy and paste that flag in dealing crate there and then let me put in their GDP and

04:31.770 --> 04:34.160
I have that information right over here.

04:35.560 --> 04:41.510
Copy and paste that save this and let's make sure the second row worked right.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.680
Perfect we have India Indian flag and then their GDP.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.670
And then finally it's time for the United Kingdom.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.240
Will put in their three selves.

04:49.350 --> 04:52.150
Tedy t.

04:52.410 --> 04:53.490
T the.

04:53.750 --> 04:57.410
And we're going to say United Kingdom

05:00.460 --> 05:07.300
image source and then there GDP Solecki GDP first copy and paste that in here.

05:08.370 --> 05:11.280
Save this and refresh to make sure you still have the connection.

05:11.280 --> 05:11.980
Perfect.

05:12.070 --> 05:15.520
And now it's time for their flag so let's grab that flag link.

05:15.550 --> 05:22.190
I'm going to just copy this from the notes and then paste it in here at their source.

05:22.210 --> 05:27.010
Good let's save that.

05:27.150 --> 05:31.230
And now with the refresh here I see the United Kingdom flag.

05:31.290 --> 05:31.690
All right.

05:31.690 --> 05:33.540
And that's really all we had to do.

05:33.540 --> 05:40.060
So we have the country flaks USA India United Kingdom their flags and then GDP.

05:40.170 --> 05:40.860
All right.

05:40.860 --> 05:43.890
So hopefully found that exercise pretty straightforward.

05:43.890 --> 05:48.770
Again you can always just reference to solutions notebook or excuse me solutions.

05:48.810 --> 05:49.810
H tim Metafile.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.660
In case you want to actually reference the code itself.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.140
All right thanks everyone.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.970
I hope that was straightforward and I'll see you at the next lecture.

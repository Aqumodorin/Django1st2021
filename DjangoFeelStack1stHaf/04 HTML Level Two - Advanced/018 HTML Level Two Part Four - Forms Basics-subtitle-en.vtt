Hello everyone and welcome to part four forms.

00:07.870 --> 00:14.310
Basics creating forms and each Malle really revolves around the idea of the in that tag.

00:14.350 --> 00:18.940
And throughout this lecture and the subsequent lectures we're going to be looking at various types of

00:18.940 --> 00:22.590
inputs for forms and how we can use them to accept user input.

00:22.630 --> 00:29.100
So if you've ever visited a Web site where you had to input your email password into the form online

00:29.110 --> 00:35.990
and then click submit that's an HMO form forms are actually going to be a key component of Django later

00:35.990 --> 00:36.420
on.

00:36.560 --> 00:40.190
But in order to really understand how to use them with Django you need to fully understand them with

00:40.220 --> 00:41.820
just pure HCM.

00:42.020 --> 00:44.630
Let's get started by looking at some basic examples.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.780
Go jump to the text editor now.

00:46.780 --> 00:50.140
All right so I'm a text editor open and I have my browser open.

00:50.150 --> 00:55.280
And before we get started I just wanted to show you the two reference links you can actually find inside

00:55.280 --> 00:59.350
the part for forms basics HTML file that correspond with this lecture.

00:59.360 --> 01:04.300
One of them goes to the W3 schools where it just talks about input types.

01:04.310 --> 01:10.300
So here you can see html input types and the basic form of an input tag is the input tag.

01:10.310 --> 01:14.090
And then we specify the type and noticed you can have text types.

01:14.090 --> 01:18.100
You can have password types submit types so has a little submit button.

01:18.320 --> 01:22.970
And later on we're going to really be exploring a bunch of other types such as radio buttons dropdown

01:22.970 --> 01:24.510
checkboxes etc..

01:24.650 --> 01:25.880
So that's the idea behind this.

01:25.880 --> 01:31.120
And if you want a more technical reference you can always check out the muzzle Developer Network web

01:31.120 --> 01:34.970
site which is also linked in that aist him l file.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.730
So let's get started by just kind of walking through this.

01:37.730 --> 01:42.730
So basically what we do is somewhere in the body you start your form.

01:42.860 --> 01:47.990
So before we actually get started I'm going to make two headings I'll say something like.

01:48.020 --> 02:00.360
Log in and then we'll say heading to please input your we'll say e-mail and password.

02:00.450 --> 02:05.210
Save that refresh over here and then we see log in please and put your email and password.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.900
Let me just zoom in a little bit on that.

02:06.900 --> 02:08.110
So it's a little clear.

02:08.130 --> 02:12.630
And here we have our two headings later on we're actually going to learn how to do civically label inputs

02:12.660 --> 02:16.920
but right now just keeping it basic let's simulate a loggin site.

02:17.040 --> 02:25.980
First we have to do then is call a form and if you want we can actually call form like this.

02:25.980 --> 02:32.550
And then we have our form or opening tag and our closing tag and we see we have a class which will make

02:32.550 --> 02:36.240
a lot more sense when we talk about C Ss so you can just ignore that for now.

02:36.240 --> 02:42.820
We have an action which is going to be later on use to actually call an action the Peniel kind of for

02:42.820 --> 02:43.540
me using.

02:43.620 --> 02:48.150
And then we have a method which is post right now we actually don't need to worry about any of these

02:48.150 --> 02:48.670
things.

02:48.780 --> 02:50.600
We're going to talk a lot more about them.

02:50.610 --> 02:56.070
But basically the action is later on we're going to be sending the data and then the method of has to

02:56.070 --> 02:58.740
do a get post a DTP method.

02:58.770 --> 03:03.690
Right now we don't know enough to really use any of these so we're just going to delete all that and

03:03.690 --> 03:06.710
just have form save that.

03:06.840 --> 03:10.450
Now let's stick our two headings inside of this form tag.

03:10.590 --> 03:16.230
And as I mentioned the main part of creating a form really revolves around those input tags.

03:16.350 --> 03:24.240
So we're going to do is call an input tag and then we notice that as we call input and then enter Adam

03:24.330 --> 03:30.630
text editor will automatically say type equals name equals and value equals and so let's break this

03:30.630 --> 03:37.560
down type is where you actually clarify what type of input you want and by default it's type text.

03:37.560 --> 03:41.610
And that's something we're going to be exploring a lot through this lecture in the next couple of lectures.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.330
Different types of inputs.

03:43.500 --> 03:48.660
Then you have the name of the input and the name of the input is just the name of scientists input so

03:48.660 --> 03:51.370
you can call it on later in some other files.

03:51.510 --> 03:57.600
And then we have the value and the value is the actual default value that's placed inside there.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.160
So let's explore this right now.

03:59.370 --> 04:05.720
Let's start off with one of the most common types of inputs which is an e-mail type and an email type

04:06.000 --> 04:12.730
basically just checks to make sure you have an email in there will give this a name and we'll call it

04:12.730 --> 04:14.560
user e-mail.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.760
So let's save this and refresh.

04:17.770 --> 04:20.880
And now we noticed that we have an actual text box here.

04:21.220 --> 04:26.280
And what's different between a normal type equals text and a type equals e-mail.

04:26.350 --> 04:32.560
Is that the e-mail type is going to make sure later on when we actually click submit that we have an

04:32.650 --> 04:36.340
at gmail dot com or at yahoo dot com.

04:36.430 --> 04:38.320
Or an actual e-mail in there.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.990
So for a normal text type input you could just put in user and it would work.

04:43.120 --> 04:48.460
But for a type e-mail it's going to make sure that you actually have X and then a dot com or a dot in

04:48.460 --> 04:48.790
there.

04:48.790 --> 04:54.670
So maybe you've been using a web site you actually mistype your e-mail and a little pop up will say

04:54.670 --> 04:57.160
Please enter a valid email address.

04:57.250 --> 05:00.820
This is the type of input they're using to automatically do that.

05:00.820 --> 05:06.340
And basically all this work is being handled behind the scenes by your browser just specifying the type

05:06.400 --> 05:08.040
will basically take care of that for you.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.690
And that's really the big part of the beauty of H-2A mail.

05:10.690 --> 05:16.810
It works across browsers that way at least for the most common types and it does create an other input

05:17.410 --> 05:18.780
or our password.

05:19.120 --> 05:26.000
So we'll say this type is password we'll save it refresh.

05:26.380 --> 05:28.570
And I noticed that we had two boxes.

05:28.570 --> 05:31.790
This was the email and this was the password.

05:31.930 --> 05:34.790
Well look what happens when I start typing in my password here.

05:34.990 --> 05:40.330
It's actually hidden from me and that sort of default behavior is happening because I specified this

05:40.330 --> 05:45.160
type to be password instead of just the default text or an email type.

05:45.160 --> 05:49.390
And these are the kind of types right now that you don't need to worry about memorizing them too much.

05:49.390 --> 05:54.280
You always have those reference links for the different input types that are in the four forms basic's

05:54.310 --> 05:56.980
that each team metafile those two links I explained earlier.

05:56.980 --> 06:00.460
But eventually you're going to be using these inputs so often that you're going to just remember off

06:00.460 --> 06:01.410
the top of your head.

06:01.450 --> 06:03.990
Oh I need an e-mail type in a password type etc..

06:04.090 --> 06:06.930
Right now don't worry too much about memorizing all of these.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.680
And let's go ahead and get this input and Main.

06:09.970 --> 06:15.730
So we will call this just a very simple name something like password and that name can later be used

06:15.730 --> 06:17.230
to actually reference this.

06:17.230 --> 06:21.150
So again you don't see anything changed here on the form.

06:21.150 --> 06:23.510
And finally let's discuss this value.

06:23.590 --> 06:28.080
So the value is if you want a value to be pre-filled there.

06:28.420 --> 06:40.660
So let's say email here and we'll say password please save that refresh and notice her the value.

06:40.660 --> 06:43.830
It basically has a corresponding default here.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.530
So e-mail here password please.

06:46.540 --> 06:51.630
But notice that right now this password please just shows up as a blank password.

06:51.630 --> 06:56.260
So it does make a whole lot of sense to put a value here into that.

06:56.260 --> 07:00.960
And later on we'll show you some better ways of actually showing some default text there.

07:01.090 --> 07:06.570
But that's what you can use if you want it to be pre-filled.

07:06.630 --> 07:12.690
And then finally one of the most important input types is the submitters and we don't need to give that

07:12.750 --> 07:17.850
a name or value but we just refresh and here we have a little submit button.

07:18.130 --> 07:19.330
And this is a little submit.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.320
But look what happens here.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.910
It says Please include an ad in the e-mail address e-mail here is missing.

07:24.040 --> 07:35.280
So let's actually give this type submit a value I will type and submit their refresh and notice.

07:35.290 --> 07:40.860
Now the submit button actually has a submit their in-call this whatever you want like please click me

07:43.380 --> 07:46.800
save that refresh Quick me.

07:46.860 --> 07:47.160
All right.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.800
So let's explain what's going on here.

07:48.840 --> 07:52.390
There's only three lines but there's actually a lot of moving parts.

07:52.530 --> 07:54.580
So if we look at this code.

07:54.690 --> 07:58.070
Everything here is wrapped in form tags.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.180
And that's actually really important.

07:59.180 --> 08:05.360
That allows them to know that we were talking about a complete form here and we have three input types.

08:05.370 --> 08:07.180
The first one is e-mail.

08:07.260 --> 08:13.020
The second one is password and the third one is submit and the key idea I want you to just take in right

08:13.020 --> 08:18.510
now is not how everything is linked and working together but really the fact that you can call an input

08:18.510 --> 08:23.250
tag specify type give it a name to reference it later on.

08:23.250 --> 08:26.310
Right now that doesn't make a whole lot of sense because they haven't really used the name yet.

08:26.430 --> 08:29.600
And then de-value which has some default value for its Ehab.

08:29.790 --> 08:33.280
Sometimes that default value doesn't make two cents such as wifi password type.

08:33.360 --> 08:38.970
Otherwise you just see a bunch of dots there or Asterix and then you sometimes really do need a value

08:38.970 --> 08:43.760
such as with the submit button where it just looks like an ugly button if you don't have the value there.

08:43.800 --> 08:44.360
All right.

08:44.520 --> 08:52.140
So this right now the submit button is linked to these two inputs because if I click click me it will

08:52.260 --> 08:56.830
actually work so I'll say something like please include it at the e-mail address.

08:56.850 --> 08:58.160
E-mail here is missing at.

08:58.350 --> 09:01.310
And that's why we want to specify something like type e-mail.

09:01.320 --> 09:09.900
So now if I say hello at yahoo dot com and then put in a password click me.

09:09.960 --> 09:10.930
Looks like it's ok.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.850
Nothing's actually happening here it's just clearing it.

09:13.860 --> 09:17.420
Every time we click Submit We'll get into that sort of functionality later.

09:17.430 --> 09:20.870
I do actually grab information from those input cells.

09:20.970 --> 09:24.850
But right now the very basics is you coliform tag.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.000
You call these input tags you specify type.

09:28.020 --> 09:32.280
You can give it a name which we'll use later on and you can give it a default value.

09:32.310 --> 09:35.580
Sometimes you're not going to really want a default value such as the password.

09:35.610 --> 09:38.510
Sometimes you really will submit button.

09:38.520 --> 09:44.190
All right let's just walk through just a couple more examples some maybe a little sillier examples of

09:44.190 --> 09:50.790
different types of inputs and a really fun one is the choose color input and it's just a color input

09:50.820 --> 09:52.470
so let me show you what that looks like.

09:52.530 --> 09:53.370
I'll say something like.

09:53.370 --> 10:04.110
Choose color as heading 1 and heading 2 is going to be click on button and then I'm going specifying

10:04.170 --> 10:09.020
input or enter there and the type is going to be a color.

10:09.030 --> 10:13.320
So let's say that refreshed this page and notice it says choose a color.

10:13.320 --> 10:16.350
Click on button and this is a default color picker.

10:16.350 --> 10:22.880
So if I click on this button right here I get this little pop up that allows me to actually pick a color.

10:22.890 --> 10:25.790
So for instance I can pick this purple color.

10:25.830 --> 10:26.350
OK.

10:26.380 --> 10:29.480
Now we can see a change to purple or we pick up bright red.

10:29.670 --> 10:30.300
It OK.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.920
And I can see it changed to bright red.

10:32.070 --> 10:38.790
So all of that functionality is built straight into T.M. just by specifying the type is equal to color

10:39.240 --> 10:41.580
and that's sort of a fun example.

10:41.580 --> 10:45.040
Now let's show one more which is essentially the default.

10:45.100 --> 10:50.600
So I'm going to say heading to will say enter some text.

10:51.460 --> 10:52.900
And then we'll have some input.

10:52.930 --> 10:57.760
And we're just going to leave it as the type the text which is the default and I say something like

10:58.560 --> 11:01.480
X goes here we'll save it.

11:01.600 --> 11:06.350
Refresh Elsy text goes here which means I can type just random text here.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.240
And it works just fine.

11:07.240 --> 11:12.390
Let's zoom in a little bit and you can see that there's really no limit on how much text that can right.

11:12.400 --> 11:18.260
Later on we learn about things like a text area type which allows us to have a larger section or like

11:18.280 --> 11:23.770
paragraphs of text but those are just a few of the input types that you can use as you begin to create

11:23.770 --> 11:24.070
form.

11:24.070 --> 11:28.810
So just the very basics here that we've covered really all I want you to be aware of is that there is

11:28.810 --> 11:35.080
a foreign tag there are input tags and you can specify the type of input and certain types of input

11:35.140 --> 11:40.150
will have restrictions such as the email type will have the restriction that you need an at symbol when

11:40.150 --> 11:41.440
you actually click that submit.

11:41.450 --> 11:46.600
But that's really all I want you to get out of this lecture for right now in the next lecture we're

11:46.600 --> 11:51.910
going to be talking about two more things we'll talk about labels and how they work when you can actually

11:51.970 --> 11:53.400
label one of these inputs.

11:53.530 --> 11:58.570
And then secondly we're going to go back and talk about that form with the action and method arguments.

11:58.570 --> 12:04.360
Remember that when I first typed in form and it had autocomplete it had these calls right here an action

12:04.390 --> 12:09.130
and a method and the next you're going to be discussing those and seeing what happens when we combine

12:09.130 --> 12:11.150
that with some sort of Submit button.

12:11.280 --> 12:11.750
OK.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.760
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

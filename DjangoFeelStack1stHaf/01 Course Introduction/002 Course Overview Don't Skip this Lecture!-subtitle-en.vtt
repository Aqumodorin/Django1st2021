00:00.330 --> 00:03.210
Hello everyone and welcome to the course overview lecture.

00:04.300 --> 00:08.860
As a quick note I have a favor to ask of you please watch this entire video lecture.

00:08.950 --> 00:14.140
Regardless if you've already taken multiple courses on you to me or even multiple courses by me or if

00:14.140 --> 00:18.910
you're brand new to you to mean or brand new to online learning in general please watch this entire

00:18.910 --> 00:22.880
lecture video will really help your course experience be a lot smoother.

00:23.020 --> 00:25.130
Thank you OK.

00:25.330 --> 00:26.270
Continue on.

00:26.350 --> 00:29.020
We're going to talk about three main things in this lecture.

00:29.050 --> 00:33.610
We'll talk about general of course information how to get the course notes and files and how to get

00:33.640 --> 00:33.970
help.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.980
During the course first off a huge thank you for enrolling.

00:39.180 --> 00:40.470
It really means the world to me.

00:40.470 --> 00:44.090
To get messages from students every day telling them I help them in the careers.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.370
Help them solve a problem at work or that they just really enjoyed the course.

00:47.370 --> 00:49.080
So thank you again for enrolling.

00:49.080 --> 00:52.490
I'm really going to try my best to make sure you have a good experience.

00:52.500 --> 00:56.960
First off let's discuss some general tips for getting the best experience with this course.

00:56.970 --> 01:01.710
You probably noticed that I speak at a pretty steady and deliberate pace so feel free to speed up the

01:01.710 --> 01:02.330
videos.

01:02.340 --> 01:05.090
You can check for a speed icon on the bottom tab.

01:05.100 --> 01:09.870
In fact you can see that this video right now I would personally probably be watching these videos at

01:09.870 --> 01:12.240
about 1.5 or 2 x speed.

01:12.270 --> 01:13.650
But that's my style.

01:13.650 --> 01:17.290
If English is not your first language you can probably also slow down the videos.

01:17.340 --> 01:19.730
So do whatever speed feels right to you.

01:21.430 --> 01:23.170
If a video ever appears blurry.

01:23.170 --> 01:27.700
Make sure to check that you're viewing the video in high definition if you want to download the videos

01:27.700 --> 01:28.910
for offline viewing.

01:28.930 --> 01:33.700
You can do that with the utility app any technical platform issues you may encounter.

01:33.700 --> 01:36.370
Please contact support you to me dot com.

01:36.370 --> 01:41.590
Technical platform issues can be things like having trouble posting to the Q&amp;A forums having trouble

01:41.590 --> 01:45.750
logging into your account or having trouble viewing the actual videos.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.230
Those are technical platform issues.

01:47.260 --> 01:48.760
I can't help you too much there.

01:48.790 --> 01:50.910
So please contact support me dot com.

01:51.070 --> 01:57.770
If you experience those type problems again the course is self-paced and you get lifetime access to

01:57.770 --> 02:00.590
the materials and that includes any updates.

02:00.650 --> 02:05.450
Also upon completion of the course you can unlock a certificate for your linked in profile and you can

02:05.450 --> 02:08.230
check out the fake Q lecture which is the very next lecture.

02:08.300 --> 02:12.150
For more information on how to unlock that certificate.

02:12.200 --> 02:15.390
Now let's talk about how to get the course materials.

02:15.520 --> 02:19.090
You can download all the files as a zip from this lecture.

02:19.090 --> 02:21.900
The fake Q lecture or the installation lecture.

02:21.990 --> 02:24.040
That's this lecture the next lecture in a lecture.

02:24.040 --> 02:28.900
After that it's the same zip file so any one of those lectures is fine.

02:28.900 --> 02:35.320
It's saved as a resource so you should see a little blue resource tab open up while you're watching

02:35.320 --> 02:36.180
the actual video.

02:36.190 --> 02:41.770
Just click on that and then download that zip file future missions to this course will get their own

02:41.980 --> 02:48.370
ZIP file in the relevant section and I will also upload an updated that zip to these 3 lectures.

02:48.370 --> 02:53.080
So what I mean by that is if later on in the future I add a new clone to this course.

02:53.080 --> 02:57.940
Maybe we make a clone of Facebook dot com then I will create 2 zip files.

02:57.940 --> 03:04.420
I will re upload an updated version of the whole zip file but I will also make a separate zip file just

03:04.420 --> 03:05.280
for that section.

03:05.290 --> 03:07.200
That way to have the read download all the notes.

03:07.330 --> 03:10.150
Every time new material is added to this course.

03:10.150 --> 03:16.630
Also as a quick note sometimes the built in unzipping program on your computer may not work for unzipping

03:16.630 --> 03:17.500
a file.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.770
Please try another program before posting to the Kewney forums.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.190
If you're having trouble unzipping files.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.590
Thanks All right.

03:25.770 --> 03:31.500
Now let's talk about how to approach the course this course is divided into sections that lead into

03:31.500 --> 03:32.460
each other.

03:32.460 --> 03:37.980
Each section can be visited independent of the others but they also assume knowledge of all the concepts

03:37.980 --> 03:44.860
covered in previous lectures has a very high level overview general curriculum or what this course has.

03:45.050 --> 03:51.110
We first talk about HCM l CSSA and Javascript and then we continue talking about the document object

03:51.110 --> 03:54.710
model and J.A.G. that's really the front end half of the course.

03:54.710 --> 03:59.210
Then the second half the course discusses the Python programming language how to work with Django and

03:59.210 --> 03:59.880
sequel.

04:00.050 --> 04:04.680
And then after that we have Web site clone projects.

04:04.690 --> 04:08.380
Also keep in mind that we do not assume any previous knowledge.

04:08.410 --> 04:11.780
So you can take this course even if you have zero program experience.

04:11.890 --> 04:15.650
We won't ever assume that you've encountered any other technology before.

04:15.760 --> 04:20.290
However that means if you already have experience you may want to read through the code notes first.

04:20.320 --> 04:24.250
Otherwise you may be viewing video lectures that just go over things you already know.

04:24.250 --> 04:29.590
Again this is trying to be a careful balance for people who have never programmed before and experienced

04:29.590 --> 04:36.180
programmers so beginners should follow through the course in order more experienced developers should

04:36.180 --> 04:41.000
probably visit the curriculum page and decide what the best starting point is for them and be honest

04:41.000 --> 04:41.750
of yourself.

04:41.760 --> 04:46.590
If you start to have trouble if a certain section you may want to go back a section and review that

04:46.590 --> 04:49.290
material OK.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.920
Now let's talk about how to get help during the course.

04:52.380 --> 04:55.440
OK so let's discuss the steps you should take whenever you need help.

04:55.440 --> 05:00.720
During the course the first thing you should do especially if you run into a programming error is use

05:00.780 --> 05:04.820
Google and stack overflow as tools to help you solve that issue.

05:04.830 --> 05:09.900
A big part of being a developer is learning how to answer your own questions by using Google and using

05:09.900 --> 05:14.730
stack overflow stack overflow or just a Web site where you can post questions and other programmers

05:14.730 --> 05:15.510
will help you out.

05:15.570 --> 05:20.280
But a lot of times almost 90 percent of the time your question has been asked by someone else and you'll

05:20.280 --> 05:23.760
already find an answer through Google and stack overflow.

05:23.910 --> 05:28.860
If you still can't find that there you may want to check out the fake Q lecture where I will be posting

05:28.860 --> 05:31.460
commonly ask questions that pertain to the course.

05:31.740 --> 05:36.300
If you still can't find that there and your question is more specific to something in the course search

05:36.300 --> 05:38.580
the Kewaunee forums for previous posts.

05:38.610 --> 05:43.440
It's likely that someone's already asked a similar question to yours while you're viewing a lecture.

05:43.440 --> 05:48.570
You can also look at the bottom tab and you should see a Q and A button you can click that and that

05:48.590 --> 05:53.420
will take it to queue in a post that actually pertains to the specific lecture that you are watching.

05:53.430 --> 05:54.820
If you still can't find the help.

05:54.930 --> 05:55.880
Not to worry.

05:55.880 --> 06:01.770
Post a new question on the Kewaunee forms please include what you've tried your code and as much information

06:01.770 --> 06:02.710
as possible.

06:02.730 --> 06:06.100
That way the students and I can quickly help you out.

06:06.180 --> 06:09.940
Here are some useful ways you can share your code online with us.

06:09.990 --> 06:17.460
You can use code append the IO codependents SEO a just and get hub or even just a plain screenshot or

06:17.460 --> 06:21.990
you can actually copy and paste with formatting your code onto that the to meet Q and 8 forums.

06:22.020 --> 06:23.410
Choose whatever you prefer.

06:24.570 --> 06:29.310
As far as some general information for the question and answer forums for this course you can usually

06:29.310 --> 06:32.490
respect the reply within 24 hours.

06:32.620 --> 06:38.580
In other students reply often so often a reply comes a lot faster in 24 hours that I checked the Kunin

06:38.600 --> 06:41.690
forums at least once a day usually more than that.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.850
You may also just get a quick link reply.

06:44.070 --> 06:50.130
So if I see a questions very similar to yours answered on stack overflow I may just reply with the link.

06:50.250 --> 06:54.780
If you're still confused by that or haven't given you enough information feel free to just continue

06:54.780 --> 06:56.750
the thread asking follow up questions.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.670
I'm always happy to help you out.

06:58.680 --> 07:03.910
Also remember to say thank you especially if another student has helped you out in reply to your question.

07:03.930 --> 07:08.380
It really helps build a great community of students answering these questions.

07:08.400 --> 07:13.320
Also it's a great idea for you to go to the Q&amp;A forums and see if you can help out other students in

07:13.320 --> 07:14.040
the course.

07:14.070 --> 07:18.180
It's a really great skill to have and it really helps your own understanding to answer other people's

07:18.180 --> 07:19.280
questions.

07:20.430 --> 07:26.010
As a final know there are many ways to program and that includes the choice of your development environment.

07:26.010 --> 07:29.510
The styling of the code your programming choices etc..

07:29.580 --> 07:33.000
I don't want you to ever feel locked into the choices we make in this course.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.960
Feel free to explore other options and also feel free to share them as well if you prefer another.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.230
Ideally you prefer another library.

07:40.230 --> 07:43.060
You have different programming styling from your experience.

07:43.140 --> 07:44.540
That's totally ok.

07:44.550 --> 07:50.110
Don't ever feel that you have to do exactly what we do in this course and again just a huge thank you

07:50.110 --> 07:51.640
for enrolling in this course.

07:51.640 --> 07:56.990
I'm so happy you have enrolled and I get to help you on your journey of becoming a web developer.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.420
I'll see you inside the course.

07:58.420 --> 07:59.050
Thanks everyone.

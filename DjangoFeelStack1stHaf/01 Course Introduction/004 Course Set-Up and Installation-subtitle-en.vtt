Hello everyone and welcome to the set up in instillation lecture before we get started.

00:10.290 --> 00:15.000
I wanted to note that there are many options for choosing your development environment and your browser.

00:15.210 --> 00:21.860
In this course we're going to be using the Adam text editor and Google Chrome if you're very experienced.

00:21.860 --> 00:25.030
Another idea that's an integrated development environment.

00:25.100 --> 00:27.070
Feel free to go ahead and use it.

00:27.290 --> 00:32.050
Maybe you already have a lot of experience with the subline text editor or high charm.

00:32.060 --> 00:33.390
That's totally ok.

00:33.410 --> 00:36.020
Feel free to use whatever feels comfortable for you.

00:36.140 --> 00:41.120
If you already have a lot of experience of a certain ID although I still highly recommend you try out

00:41.160 --> 00:44.970
Adam I've learned to really enjoy it and it works really well.

00:45.020 --> 00:49.120
It's all the material in this course as far as the browser choice goes.

00:49.130 --> 00:51.140
We do ask that you please use Chrome.

00:51.170 --> 00:55.760
It is by far the most popular choice for web developers and I also want to make sure that the sites

00:55.850 --> 00:59.260
that I run in this course will also run on your computer.

00:59.360 --> 01:03.740
Again in this lecture we're going to show you where you can install Adam text editor from and give you

01:03.740 --> 01:04.870
a quick tour of it.

01:04.880 --> 01:05.980
Let's get started.

01:05.990 --> 01:08.400
Go to Google in your browser.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.240
OK so in your browser if you don't have google chrome.

01:11.360 --> 01:17.040
What you should do is go to Google dot com slash chrome or just google search for the term Google Chrome

01:17.610 --> 01:21.870
and eventually you'll find this page right here which is Gool about com slash Chrome.

01:21.870 --> 01:26.220
There may be a bunch of information about their Chrome books which are their physical products.

01:26.220 --> 01:32.310
What we really want is just Google Chrome itself so you can click here on download click for personal

01:32.310 --> 01:35.920
computers and then click on the download link for the web browser.

01:36.450 --> 01:36.760
OK.

01:36.780 --> 01:38.190
So that's making it Google Chrome.

01:38.190 --> 01:39.450
It's just a web browser.

01:39.450 --> 01:45.570
I'm sure many of you are or most of you are already familiar with it then to actually get the text editor

01:45.570 --> 01:47.920
for this course go to atom.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.830
Io that's 80 m dot.

01:50.890 --> 01:55.050
Oh and this is the Adam text editor that we're using for the course.

01:55.410 --> 02:01.890
And the reason we use Adam text editor is because it can support across platforms that OS X Windows

02:01.890 --> 02:02.550
Linux.

02:02.580 --> 02:06.660
It has a built in package manager so you can search for and install new packages.

02:06.660 --> 02:10.290
You can even create your own packages and plug ins all from within atom.

02:10.340 --> 02:15.570
It has smart auto completion that will be using a lot during the course file system browser multiple

02:15.570 --> 02:21.190
panes find replace features has a lot of stuff that we're going to be using often throughout the course.

02:21.360 --> 02:26.680
Now other text editors also have these exact same features so Adam is not unique in these aspects.

02:26.730 --> 02:30.260
But it works really well for what we're going to be doing for the course.

02:30.760 --> 02:35.410
The main reason I really like Adam though is if you scroll all the way down there's two really interesting

02:35.410 --> 02:36.300
things about it.

02:36.310 --> 02:40.990
The first thing that I really like is that it's totally open source so it's totally free it's open source

02:41.260 --> 02:46.330
and if you really want to make a change to the Adam text editor you can make a contribution and help

02:46.330 --> 02:46.960
improve.

02:47.040 --> 02:52.570
Adam text editor and then the second thing which is kind of more of a curiosity slash really interesting

02:52.780 --> 02:59.800
aspect of it is that atom itself is actually built with a lot of the front end technologies are we in

02:59.800 --> 03:06.510
this course it runs with h tim l javascript CSSA and a javascript library called node.

03:06.580 --> 03:07.170
Yes.

03:07.360 --> 03:13.000
And then it runs all that on a framework called electron which allows you to use web technologies actually

03:13.000 --> 03:15.190
build desktop applications.

03:15.190 --> 03:20.620
So that's just a little side fact we won't be dealing with electron at all in this course but maybe

03:20.620 --> 03:25.150
after you've done taking this course you're interested in developing desktop applications will you'll

03:25.150 --> 03:28.950
be able to use a lot of the skills in this course to build something like atom.

03:29.260 --> 03:32.380
So that's just a quick side note to actually install Adam.

03:32.410 --> 03:33.730
It's quite simple.

03:33.730 --> 03:35.990
Just click here on the installation button.

03:36.070 --> 03:38.790
If you're on Windows this will download an executable file.

03:38.830 --> 03:39.820
You just double click it.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.570
Run through the installation process.

03:41.620 --> 03:45.260
If you're on a Mac OS this will be something like a dmg file again.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.020
Double click it.

03:46.060 --> 03:52.210
Run through the installation process and then if you're on Ubuntu I believe it's a tar file that you

03:52.210 --> 03:54.210
can just then unpack.

03:54.220 --> 03:58.140
OK so let me hop over to the Adam text editor and show you what it looks like.

03:58.580 --> 04:04.000
OK so once you've opened Adam for the first time you should see a welcome guide and this is just a really

04:04.000 --> 04:05.300
useful guide for you.

04:05.310 --> 04:10.030
It has a bunch of information about the various features of ADOM such as how to open a project install

04:10.030 --> 04:11.560
a package choose a theme.

04:11.590 --> 04:16.780
If you don't like the default color theme you can just click here on choose a theme and then open the

04:16.780 --> 04:19.720
theme picker and then check the other themes out.

04:19.720 --> 04:24.960
You can even customize the styling and you can do anything with SS that we learned later on in this

04:24.970 --> 04:25.360
course.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.710
That's pretty cool as well.

04:26.950 --> 04:28.770
And then you can actually add snippets.

04:28.770 --> 04:30.340
Learn keyboard shortcuts.

04:30.340 --> 04:32.500
I would recommend you check out these keyboard shortcuts.

04:32.500 --> 04:36.730
I'll be telling you the most useful ones as we continue throughout the course but the main thing I want

04:36.730 --> 04:38.530
to show you is how to open a project.

04:38.590 --> 04:44.080
So if you click on open a project will open a file open her see just click open a project here and then

04:44.080 --> 04:45.890
you can select any folder you want.

04:46.030 --> 04:51.580
So hopefully by now you've downloaded the files that go of this course and then you can just add that

04:51.790 --> 04:55.750
select that folder and add it to the actual file path.

04:55.770 --> 04:57.230
So let me show you what that looks like.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.510
I'll just select this folder right here.

05:02.020 --> 05:02.920
And here it can see.

05:02.920 --> 05:06.260
I've selected a folder Django lecture's has some files in it.

05:06.370 --> 05:10.200
If you want to open a file you just click on it and then it opens up the file itself.

05:10.380 --> 05:14.500
And here you can see I have some H-2 him all code and that's basically we're going to be doing throughout

05:14.560 --> 05:15.580
the rest of the course.

05:15.640 --> 05:19.990
We're just going to be running through your project folders and then adding files here.

05:20.130 --> 05:24.930
And if you ever want to collapse this directory all you have to do is do command or control backslash

05:25.690 --> 05:27.840
and then you can open and close that.

05:28.270 --> 05:31.120
All right so that's the very basics of Adam.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.910
That's really all you need to know throughout the rest of the course.

05:33.910 --> 05:38.110
We're going to be showing you more and more features of Adam and then playing around a lot more.

05:38.110 --> 05:41.180
OK thanks everyone and I will see you at the next lecture.

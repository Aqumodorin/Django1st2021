Hello everyone and welcome back to this continued solution's lecture of the cap project one we're going

00:10.480 --> 00:11.080
to get to York.

00:11.170 --> 00:16.870
We left off last time and finished the project by just editing the CSSA file to make the styling look

00:16.870 --> 00:19.960
the same as what we wanted to cap some project going to look like.

00:20.140 --> 00:22.540
Let's go to the editor and browser and get started.

00:22.850 --> 00:23.160
OK.

00:23.170 --> 00:28.150
So here I am at my editor what I'm first going to do is edit the main things in the body that I want

00:28.150 --> 00:28.800
to change.

00:28.810 --> 00:31.530
We've already taken care of the font family.

00:31.540 --> 00:36.760
The next thing I want to do is take care of the background color remember the background color was actually

00:36.760 --> 00:38.380
a dark background.

00:38.920 --> 00:44.880
So all I did choose just any color you want that's dark or any light color it doesn't really matter

00:44.890 --> 00:47.150
that's not really the point of this exercise.

00:47.170 --> 00:50.300
The background color that I ended up choosing was hex code.

00:50.310 --> 00:54.090
0 1 1 6 2 7.

00:54.250 --> 00:59.770
And because we have a dark background color it means the actual color of our text which we can call

00:59.770 --> 01:04.840
by just color needs to be a lighter color or can just be whites or cream.

01:04.960 --> 01:07.020
So I choose hex code.

01:07.060 --> 01:11.430
F D F F F C colon.

01:11.430 --> 01:15.140
So let's make sure that worked out well refresh this page.

01:15.180 --> 01:15.510
Great.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.700
So Eric back to the dark blue.

01:17.730 --> 01:20.950
And now the white text.

01:21.030 --> 01:24.840
Next thing I want to do is actually align everything to be centered.

01:25.080 --> 01:30.430
So I will say text align center refresh make sure that works.

01:30.460 --> 01:32.160
Everything is looking great there.

01:32.170 --> 01:33.970
Now let's work with that border.

01:34.920 --> 01:38.580
So the border is actually going to be quite thick.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.690
So the official solution is have it at 60 pixels but I'm a little zoomed in here.

01:42.690 --> 01:49.760
So let's just do something like 40 pixels and let's make it a solid border.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.330
And here we can actually use a hex code again.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.830
And the hex could either it was a teal color.

01:55.070 --> 02:00.350
So he said to e c 4 8 6.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.810
Again don't worry if your colors don't match exactly.

02:02.840 --> 02:04.910
You really have all the flexibility you want.

02:04.910 --> 02:10.040
As far as the colors go but here we have the border looking good.

02:10.190 --> 02:18.670
But remember that we also wanted to get rid of this top border which means I can just say quarter top

02:18.910 --> 02:21.130
and assign it to be of pixels.

02:21.130 --> 02:26.920
That's a very quick way for us to essentially get rid of that top border and leave it to be that background

02:26.920 --> 02:27.530
color.

02:28.320 --> 02:35.400
And then finally if I want to make the call even closer I can call something like margin to be zero

02:35.400 --> 02:41.520
pixels to try to slim down the distance between the border and the actual edge.

02:41.520 --> 02:46.740
So again if I comment that out and refresh this I can see there's a little bit of gap between the border

02:47.040 --> 02:49.370
and the edge of the browser there.

02:49.660 --> 02:52.570
I undo that to give it at zero pixel margin.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.520
Then I squeeze all the way to the end.

02:54.790 --> 02:55.270
OK.

02:56.200 --> 03:02.920
So now let's take care of some of the individual elements so the paragraph we already have that color

03:02.930 --> 03:04.710
working correctly because it's in the body.

03:04.970 --> 03:09.940
Well we might want to do is add a little more padding so it's just practice doing that.

03:09.990 --> 03:17.750
Lawyers say patting on the top is something like 5 percent

03:21.210 --> 03:23.670
padding on the left.

03:23.780 --> 03:34.380
We can say 20 percent of it can say padding on the right is 20 percent so we can save that and refresh

03:34.380 --> 03:39.440
over here and now that's been able to kind of elongate the landing page for us.

03:39.480 --> 03:43.110
So looks a little more like the solutions.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.340
And then finally we also want to start editing some of the sizes here.

03:47.430 --> 03:53.430
So if you look here the first thing last name email and the form in general things are looking a little

03:53.430 --> 03:59.910
smaller than or actually the same size as the paragraph but we want to be a little larger.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.550
So they're looking a little smaller and referencing the solution.

04:02.730 --> 04:12.010
So let's expand that something it can do is try calling form and say everything in the forum tag has

04:12.010 --> 04:15.790
a font size and call it with it.

04:15.910 --> 04:20.740
So it's in relationship to everything else to the body text.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.030
So refresh this.

04:22.090 --> 04:25.260
Now we're looking at a much larger font size here.

04:26.810 --> 04:33.850
And if I don't like the spacing here I can also add a margin so I can say something like margin or I

04:33.850 --> 04:40.350
could even just give it to the bottom and give it a small margin like something like 10 pixels.

04:40.390 --> 04:45.370
And again this is really up to you this is just so that border doesn't touch that bottom button.

04:45.370 --> 04:47.560
Now let's talk about that bottom button.

04:47.560 --> 04:55.810
Remember we gave that bottom button in idea called some so I can say hash tag sub and let's give it

04:56.740 --> 05:02.000
a color background so I'll say background color in this Lucias lecture was gold.

05:02.020 --> 05:02.770
So that's all.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.170
Just give it.

05:04.180 --> 05:10.350
In my case the next card I found was f f 9 F 1 c.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.340
Let's refresh this.

05:11.340 --> 05:12.540
Make sure it works.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.120
Looks like it's gold now.

05:14.220 --> 05:16.230
Now let's make it much larger.

05:16.230 --> 05:18.370
So it's Add in a heights.

05:18.600 --> 05:27.540
Say About 80 pixels and also give it a with of let's make it a little larger something like 150 pixels

05:28.650 --> 05:31.070
save this refresh.

05:31.590 --> 05:32.780
OK it's looking pretty large.

05:32.790 --> 05:34.860
Now let's continue.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.700
Let's give it a bit of a margin.

05:38.130 --> 05:43.430
So it's not directly touching that e-mail and it will give it something like a four pixel margin there.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.510
Looks a little nicer since it's not directly touching.

05:47.540 --> 05:50.410
And if we want to we can make the top marginal a little better.

05:50.410 --> 05:55.480
So we'll say something like wups for pixels.

05:56.300 --> 06:06.990
Something like margin top let's specifically give that to be let's say triple that 10 pixels so we refresh

06:07.130 --> 06:10.290
and it looks a little nicer and the spacing here great.

06:10.320 --> 06:15.900
Now finally a couple of things we wanted to do is the font size is a little small so I'll call font

06:15.900 --> 06:23.550
size again say 1.5 CM and they also want to show you the trick for curving the button.

06:23.800 --> 06:28.630
So right now by default the button is square if I want to give it some curve.

06:28.900 --> 06:35.050
The term for that is border radius and then we can define a certain amount of pixels that we want the

06:35.050 --> 06:38.110
radius borders have which are basically just round the corner.

06:38.110 --> 06:45.010
So if I refresh this I can see it says sign me and right now the font is a little too big.

06:45.430 --> 06:50.420
So what we can do is actually just call it back to let's say one E-M.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.850
See if that fixes it.

06:51.850 --> 06:53.650
Sign me up OK that's looking good.

06:53.650 --> 06:58.420
So our actual font sizes is OK and it looks like everything is working.

06:58.420 --> 06:59.800
So let's try this now.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.550
We'll say hello first thaim fill in the last name.

07:07.610 --> 07:08.910
Email.

07:09.090 --> 07:10.570
Click on sign me up.

07:10.860 --> 07:13.090
And it takes me to thank you for signing up.

07:13.170 --> 07:16.250
So we're able to just quickly walk through an example landing page.

07:16.260 --> 07:21.440
Obviously it doesn't do much more just free to practice looking at something and recreating it.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.930
And so far looks pretty good.

07:23.970 --> 07:26.510
Feel free to play around a lot more.

07:26.520 --> 07:30.600
Feel free to explore the official solutions that I've left free in the downloaded folder.

07:30.620 --> 07:34.830
They're a little different than what we went through here but basically the same idea okay if you have

07:34.830 --> 07:38.520
any questions feel free to post the Kewaunee forums and I'll be happy to help you up.

07:38.580 --> 07:39.960
I'll see you at the next lecture.

00:04.860 --> 00:09.450
Hello everyone and welcome back in this lecture will be cutting through the solutions for the coffee

00:09.450 --> 00:13.070
lover bootstrap project that I explained in the previous lecture.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.890
Let's show her editor and browser and get started.

00:15.900 --> 00:21.300
OK so here you have my browser open just a quick reminder we're going to do is create this Jumbotron

00:21.630 --> 00:23.640
add some content to the Jumbotron.

00:23.640 --> 00:24.960
Have these two paragraphs here.

00:24.960 --> 00:30.180
These large sums add the pictures the coffees the thumbnail class and then make sure that we have the

00:30.180 --> 00:30.960
nav bar.

00:31.080 --> 00:35.700
And then if I click on the sign and it takes me to the form we also want to make sure that we get the

00:35.700 --> 00:36.880
grid system right.

00:36.960 --> 00:42.540
Or actually adding these thumbnails of the coffee pictures and we have the links to these coffee pictures

00:42.540 --> 00:44.710
right here on these links right here.

00:44.850 --> 00:48.180
So one two three takes it to images of coffee.

00:48.210 --> 00:50.010
OK let's get started.

00:50.010 --> 00:52.990
All right so I have my editor here open with my browser behind it.

00:53.070 --> 00:57.990
I've opened up a new project thirty's Tamil file so I'm going to just link to it now.

00:58.920 --> 01:03.260
So I've copied its full path and I'm going to paste it here into my browser.

01:03.250 --> 01:04.820
So right now it's blank.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.260
Let's add in CMH T.M. code.

01:07.460 --> 01:09.380
It's called the title of it Project.

01:09.390 --> 01:11.100
And let's also add the link.

01:11.100 --> 01:14.430
We're going to need for bootstrap itself.

01:14.430 --> 01:20.400
So I'm just going to copy and paste that from the Web site already have it open on another window on

01:20.400 --> 01:26.420
another screen so I save that and then let's add an just the heading here to make sure things working

01:27.230 --> 01:28.510
well stay connected.

01:29.280 --> 01:32.430
Refresh over here and I can see I'm connected.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.350
Great.

01:33.390 --> 01:37.290
So the first thing I want to take care of is probably the nav bar.

01:37.290 --> 01:43.610
So we know that's going to be just here on top of the page all we have to do for that is add an NAV.

01:43.850 --> 01:52.710
And remember we have a class here and it's going to be nav bar and I'm going to also add an nav bar

01:52.740 --> 02:00.170
dot or dash Inv. which is going to allow us to have that darker color here refreshed that I can say

02:00.170 --> 02:05.230
I have my nav bar Inv. doesn't have anything inside of it yet so let's add in those things.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.600
In our case it's just one other item.

02:09.510 --> 02:20.060
So we'll end up doing is putting an unordered list in there and we can give it the class nav bar dash

02:20.140 --> 02:20.780
Nev..

02:20.810 --> 02:25.310
And before that actually Nev. space for that.

02:25.830 --> 02:33.560
And then the list item I want to here is an anchor tag with an H reference of my Sign-Up page and I've

02:33.570 --> 02:36.090
called my Sign-Up page and I'm working right now.

02:36.090 --> 02:44.410
New underscore Sign-Up thought HTL and this is going to say seinen.

02:44.610 --> 02:47.500
Let's save that refresh.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.660
Now I can see here I have seinen but notice here I also have this welcome.

02:51.690 --> 02:53.450
So let's add that in as well.

02:53.580 --> 02:56.280
And that's going to be a brand.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.300
So let's put that in.

02:58.370 --> 03:07.620
Which means it's going to be underneath the nav tag or create a div and this one takes nav bar dash

03:07.620 --> 03:08.490
header.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.450
And again I don't expect you to memorize these.

03:10.470 --> 03:16.220
Just be able to reference the documentation for what you need and then we'll put an anchor tag here.

03:16.410 --> 03:18.360
The class that's going to have

03:20.830 --> 03:31.510
is the nav bar brand and the ATRA if we wanted to have just the hash tag and we'll say something like

03:31.510 --> 03:38.810
welcome let's refresh make sure it got in there and there's our welcome sign in if I click sign in it

03:38.810 --> 03:40.630
takes me to the new Sign-Up.

03:40.670 --> 03:41.780
All right.

03:41.780 --> 03:44.260
Looks like a nav bar is working as we want it to work.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.280
We come back here at the bootstrap project.

03:46.340 --> 03:48.710
It's a little bigger here than what we have here.

03:49.460 --> 03:51.960
That that's actually because I'm zoomed in on this page.

03:51.970 --> 03:55.640
Suffice zoom in on this page will get the same size.

03:55.750 --> 04:01.190
So you can see here I have the little plus thing if I just actually reset the default.

04:01.330 --> 04:04.260
I'll get the same size that I have on the screen.

04:05.140 --> 04:09.810
OK so now bars taken care of if I click sign then it takes me to that and you sign up page.

04:09.860 --> 04:16.180
Let's actually just copy and paste this code that we have so far and put it on the news sign up page.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.630
In fact I'm going to copy this entire page.

04:18.860 --> 04:25.130
Put it on my news sign up HTL page and then instead of taking it to sign in I'm going to change this

04:25.140 --> 04:34.710
to landing page and then have it take me to the original HMO which is new underscore project.

04:35.040 --> 04:39.130
We'll save that refresh over here.

04:39.130 --> 04:44.730
And now I have this link to the landing page on my sign up page and the note kicks in takes it to the

04:44.730 --> 04:48.820
landing page to see how it's changing it back and forth.

04:48.850 --> 04:49.260
OK.

04:49.350 --> 04:50.150
Great.

04:50.160 --> 04:54.670
So let's come back to our main new project buddy Tim Page.

04:54.840 --> 04:55.950
Check out the bootstrap project.

04:55.950 --> 04:57.930
We still need to add and this Jumbotron.

04:58.020 --> 04:59.660
So let's go ahead and do that.

04:59.670 --> 05:05.460
First thing I want to do is put it all in a container so I have that deal with the container class and

05:05.460 --> 05:08.010
then I'll end up doing is putting in the Jumbotron here.

05:09.090 --> 05:11.790
So say Divx put in the jumbotron

05:14.660 --> 05:20.060
and then we'll say H-1 coffee lover projects

05:23.820 --> 05:29.910
and then let's just add in some paragraphs of lordship some here just so we have a little bit of content

05:30.210 --> 05:31.480
on the page.

05:31.620 --> 05:38.150
We'll save that refresh our project and we can see here we have coffee lover project Lorem some larm

05:38.280 --> 05:39.370
some.

05:39.570 --> 05:44.470
So we come back to a bootstrap project we've created a general landing page for Jumbotron.

05:44.510 --> 05:50.520
We created an avatar on the page at least the other ASML we added two paragraphs and Lord of the Jumbotron.

05:50.670 --> 05:55.440
And next we used a grid system to add in the thumbnail pictures of coffee and we have all those links

05:55.440 --> 05:57.790
right here one two three four five six.

05:58.020 --> 06:02.210
So coming back down I'm going to need to add in those pictures.

06:02.310 --> 06:03.570
So how do actually do that.

06:03.870 --> 06:09.000
Well since I want to take advantage of the grid system for the resizing of that I want to make sure

06:09.000 --> 06:11.680
that it's in a container and then in a row.

06:12.090 --> 06:16.010
So create a new div have it be container.

06:16.080 --> 06:20.160
I could have also just put it in here in this container but sometimes it's nice to separate out your

06:20.160 --> 06:21.040
code this way.

06:21.900 --> 06:31.760
Put heading 2 and have it say pictures of coffee and then all manually code out the first actual row

06:31.760 --> 06:34.210
and then we'll just copy and paste for the rest of them.

06:34.310 --> 06:40.750
So the next thing I want is the row class and then here I'll make another div

06:43.710 --> 06:47.540
and let's put this all in one line I remember.

06:47.580 --> 06:53.920
I want it to be at least three columns of pictures across on the largest setting.

06:53.940 --> 06:59.370
So if I expand this I see three pictures across the largest setting and on the smallest setting it should

06:59.370 --> 07:00.510
just be two pictures.

07:00.690 --> 07:07.000
So you can see the pictures actually get smaller to adjust for that as I go on so expanding this again.

07:07.780 --> 07:10.010
Three and at the smallest it's going to be too.

07:10.070 --> 07:11.130
No matter how small it gets.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.660
It's always two pictures across.

07:12.730 --> 07:18.110
No matter how big it gets it's always three pictures across which means I want something like this.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.730
I won't call on large.

07:21.730 --> 07:29.250
I want each picture to take up four units out of those 12 units because four times three is 12.

07:29.290 --> 07:34.890
And then at the very smallest call extra small.

07:34.890 --> 07:38.940
I wanted to take six units so six times two is 12.

07:39.420 --> 07:45.990
And then the next thing I want to do is add in the thumbnail class and the thumbnail class allows us

07:45.990 --> 07:50.880
to actually make these pictures of the thumbnails and let's explore what that looks like in the documentation

07:51.600 --> 07:52.880
coming to get bootstrapped.

07:52.890 --> 07:58.060
Com I can click on the components and over here on the right hand side I'll see and look down that there

07:58.070 --> 07:58.890
is thumbnails.

07:58.920 --> 08:03.750
So clicking on that I see I can extend this Tripps grid system with the thumbnail component to easily

08:03.750 --> 08:07.530
display grids of images videos text and more.

08:07.530 --> 08:13.710
And this is kind of going to look like almost like Pinterest style photos and they show you an example

08:13.710 --> 08:15.930
here of what these actually look like.

08:15.960 --> 08:20.910
But the main thing to notice is that all we have to do is say class thumbnail and what thumbnail allows

08:20.910 --> 08:25.780
you to do is actually expand the call to the class on the outside.

08:25.810 --> 08:30.940
So by default these tropes thumbnails are designed to showcase linked images with some minimal required

08:30.940 --> 08:35.800
markup and then you can also put in custom content which we won't be doing here but you can see that

08:35.800 --> 08:40.950
I could even add in this little heading some paragraphs statements and some buttons as well.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.930
So those are two examples of what thumbnails look like.

08:43.930 --> 08:48.170
Basically all you had to do was add in the thumbnail class.

08:48.330 --> 08:53.970
So coming back to our project we're going to add in here a thumbnail and then we're going to add an

08:53.970 --> 09:00.720
image tag right here and we want to make sure that our source matches up to the coffee picture and all

09:00.720 --> 09:06.640
those coffee picture sources are available to here on the Bitstrips she can click on one of them and

09:06.640 --> 09:10.000
I'll take you to this link right here so I can just copy and paste this link.

09:11.230 --> 09:13.510
And then put it as the source of my image.

09:14.360 --> 09:20.700
Save this and then if I refresh my project I can begin to see the first picture of my coffee.

09:20.720 --> 09:26.840
So now instead of just repeating those steps over and over again I'm going to copy and paste all these

09:26.840 --> 09:29.560
from the solutions.

09:29.590 --> 09:31.040
It's basically just duplicate.

09:31.150 --> 09:31.990
Over and over again.

09:31.990 --> 09:39.020
So I copy and paste these Let's shift tab over and I can see here I have everything the same.

09:39.150 --> 09:46.330
Just linking two different images that I have on the solutions so let's save that refresh over here

09:46.620 --> 09:51.100
and I can say I have my pictures of coffee three across three at cross.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.860
Everything's looking good.

09:52.930 --> 09:53.420
OK.

09:53.620 --> 09:59.370
Now that's actually all I really needed for the project itself as far as the main sign up page.

09:59.380 --> 10:04.750
Delivering a check now is if I begin to decrease this it turns into two columns which we see it eventually

10:04.770 --> 10:08.440
that's great even as it gets smaller states too.

10:08.500 --> 10:12.410
Now I just need to fix the sign up page which is currently blank right now.

10:12.520 --> 10:13.570
So let's do that.

10:14.600 --> 10:17.850
Let me click open my new sign up page which is right here.

10:17.990 --> 10:19.780
New underscore sign up each T.M..

10:19.850 --> 10:23.450
It only has NEVER right now so we need to add in the forms.

10:23.450 --> 10:26.430
If we take a look at what the solutions looked like.

10:26.440 --> 10:31.790
So coming back here clicking on seinen I can see there was actually a large Jumbotron saying to log

10:31.790 --> 10:33.580
in and email password.

10:33.770 --> 10:36.570
So let's add that in to our sign up page.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.980
It's going to come outside of this.

10:38.980 --> 10:47.100
Now I've been going to say whoops div put in a container.

10:47.600 --> 10:59.000
Another day with the Jumbotron itself and then I'm going to just put it heading on log in and then the

10:59.000 --> 11:07.290
paragraph is going to say Enter your email and password.

11:08.110 --> 11:09.310
So let's save that.

11:09.310 --> 11:12.850
Make sure it actually registered a far site refresh.

11:12.870 --> 11:13.180
Great.

11:13.180 --> 11:15.640
So there's a log in and three email and password.

11:15.640 --> 11:22.780
Now it's time to just add in the form Selsey form and there's an action here in this study.

11:22.780 --> 11:27.070
Tim L. We really don't need to worry about any action because we're not actually going to lead anywhere

11:27.460 --> 11:28.820
and we don't need to worry about the method.

11:28.900 --> 11:32.860
If we wanted this to lead somewhere else to another page and the back end we could have filled that

11:32.860 --> 11:33.180
in.

11:33.190 --> 11:34.880
But we don't need to worry about that.

11:34.930 --> 11:36.780
The class however we do need to worry about.

11:36.790 --> 11:44.520
So we'll say form that group member that's the class we've been working with for bootstrap forms.

11:44.860 --> 11:56.010
And then I want to add in a label and an input first one is going to be my email and put.

11:56.250 --> 12:05.030
And we're going to give this class formed dash control member the two main classes we were working with

12:05.030 --> 12:08.000
and we were working with inputs and forms.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.900
It was Forum group and forum control and then the label I want for this is email and I want to make

12:14.900 --> 12:21.540
sure this has a name so we'll give it a name user E-M for user email and make sure we assign it the

12:21.600 --> 12:22.900
label user.

12:22.920 --> 12:27.420
E-M now we don't need actually give it a value.

12:27.770 --> 12:36.460
Instead let's give it a placeholder and we'll say email just looks a little nicer.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.280
Let's save that.

12:37.270 --> 12:39.400
Make sure it worked well refresh.

12:39.720 --> 12:39.960
Great.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.720
Here's our email but notice it's going all the way across.

12:42.730 --> 12:49.200
It's actually not in a container class which means I need to come back here and either put it back into

12:49.200 --> 12:51.850
this original container or create a new container.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.340
It's up to you depending how you want to organize your code.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.290
But I'll just put it in a new container.

12:59.130 --> 13:06.000
Well scrap this form put in that new container refresh and here we have it in a nice container.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.300
OK so we have our e-mail looking nice the container.

13:08.310 --> 13:16.150
Let's come back up here and actually add in to our form the password the checkbox and the submit button.

13:16.230 --> 13:23.370
So this will look really similar for the password so I can actually just copy this pasted in here and

13:23.370 --> 13:25.590
change the things I need to change.

13:25.590 --> 13:32.730
So for instance I want to change the actual label to say password and also change for instead of user

13:32.810 --> 13:41.760
E-M I'll say user pass which means I need to change this name over here to user pass and to change the

13:41.760 --> 13:45.200
type to password.

13:45.220 --> 13:49.260
I'll keep class form control the same and then placeholder.

13:49.540 --> 13:53.260
We're going to say password here.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.000
Let's save this refresh make sure it all worked.

13:56.290 --> 13:57.940
And there's our e-mail there's a password.

13:57.940 --> 13:58.790
Looking good.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.650
Now it's add that checkbox.

14:00.650 --> 14:05.110
Remember that checkbox just said something like keep me logged in.

14:05.290 --> 14:18.240
So I create a div and will give it the class checkbox we'll call a label will say it's for user check

14:19.320 --> 14:23.300
say keep me log.

14:23.300 --> 14:33.080
Then it doesn't matter if we capitalize everything and then I want the input to be a checkbox input

14:33.080 --> 14:38.090
with the name user check.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.860
Let's save that and see what we get when I refresh this.

14:41.860 --> 14:47.300
So it says keep me logged in but know that it's actually on top of my checkbox.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.760
So let's fix that.

14:49.040 --> 14:55.100
The way to fix that is by actually putting in my label wrapped around the input.

14:55.100 --> 14:58.780
So I'm going to grab this input over here.

14:59.690 --> 15:03.560
And make sure I call in the correct form.

15:03.800 --> 15:08.350
So I'm going to pass it in before the keep me logged in.

15:08.360 --> 15:12.600
So now let's save this refresh and I can see here.

15:12.660 --> 15:17.190
Now I have my check box before the actual label keep me logged in.

15:17.190 --> 15:24.140
So again the way I did that if I expand this window scroll to the left here is I called the label said

15:24.240 --> 15:32.110
input type and then had the techs keep me logged in and closed off that label then I just want to add

15:32.110 --> 15:34.120
in the submit button.

15:34.180 --> 15:38.100
So I will call button type is going to be submit.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.660
It could have also set input.

15:39.790 --> 15:41.460
It's up to you.

15:41.890 --> 15:50.060
And let's give it the class between between defaults and that's just something you can reference off

15:50.090 --> 15:55.670
documentation depending on what you want to look like you could have styled it as a success button or

15:55.670 --> 15:59.930
a primary really up to you if we refresh this.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.910
You can see now we have this button here Our it doesn't actually have anything in it.

16:04.070 --> 16:10.020
So let's add in something like submit save it refresh.

16:10.160 --> 16:14.000
And here we see submit and now are Web sites looking pretty good.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.740
So we'll come back to the landing page we see coffee lover project the pictures of the coffee company

16:18.740 --> 16:19.660
to sign in.

16:19.700 --> 16:20.950
We see a log in.

16:21.110 --> 16:27.640
I can put in an email and I can put in a password select to keep me locked in and submit.

16:27.670 --> 16:30.170
All right that's really all you have to do for this project.

16:30.190 --> 16:35.290
I know it can seem really intimidating at first when you see this version of the project the actual

16:35.290 --> 16:36.340
official one.

16:36.550 --> 16:42.430
So everything of the instructions but hopefully you saw from what we learned here in the solutions video

16:42.430 --> 16:44.770
that it's actually pretty straightforward.

16:44.830 --> 16:49.210
We didn't even reference the documentation that much for what we had to do a lot of it was just covered

16:49.210 --> 16:49.930
in the videos.

16:49.930 --> 16:55.660
Now I know some things such as remembering what these classes are such as forum group or forum control

16:56.140 --> 17:00.130
may seem tedious at this point in time but these are things we're going to be using often enough when

17:00.130 --> 17:02.720
you're working a bootstrap they'll actually remember them.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.730
And I know I keep saying that you'll reference the documentation a lot but even for simple things like

17:06.730 --> 17:10.340
this which is actually a pretty good looking landing page.

17:10.480 --> 17:14.990
You don't have the reference documentation that much with the mount of practice you're going to be getting

17:14.990 --> 17:16.530
of bootstrap in this course.

17:16.730 --> 17:17.480
OK.

17:17.650 --> 17:19.210
So I hope you enjoyed the project.

17:19.210 --> 17:20.440
I will see you at the next lecture.

00:05.310 --> 00:09.870
Hello everyone and welcome to part three of the bootstrap section of the course where we talk about

00:09.870 --> 00:15.930
Neph bars Neph bars are those navigational bars that you often see on the top of the Web site.

00:15.990 --> 00:20.130
We've actually already seen them on booze trips his own Web site and in this section of the course we're

00:20.130 --> 00:22.880
going to show you how to manage to create the basics of NF bar.

00:22.920 --> 00:28.620
So when we start out coding we'll actually code line by line a very basic nav bar and then later on

00:28.620 --> 00:33.030
we're just going to be copying and pasting from the course notes and the reason for that is a lot of

00:33.030 --> 00:38.880
the class calls that bootstrap uses for the nav bar components are really repetitive and kind of hard

00:38.880 --> 00:39.960
to memorize.

00:39.960 --> 00:45.450
There are things such as navs space nav bar dash nav and it gets a little confusing and the naming convention

00:45.480 --> 00:48.750
is a little bit of a poor choice specially we're trying to memorize things.

00:48.750 --> 00:53.190
So we're really just going to be copying and pasting to focus on just accessing the information or learning

00:53.190 --> 00:58.950
what it does seeing what's available if bootstrap instead of memorizing how you could code out a bar

00:58.950 --> 00:59.940
from scratch.

00:59.940 --> 01:02.700
So we'll focus on just the basics for cutting it out by scratch.

01:02.700 --> 01:07.090
Everything else was going to be copy and paste from the course notes so keep that in mind as we continue.

01:08.160 --> 01:13.290
We're also going to see briefly how to connect and HDMI LPs to javascript and Jake Query and we haven't

01:13.290 --> 01:17.310
really discussed those two technologies yet and we're definitely not going to dive into them really

01:17.310 --> 01:22.080
that deeply at all this lecture but we actually need them for some functionality of the nav bar such

01:22.080 --> 01:27.210
as a dropdown menu being on the nav bar only really works when you connect the HTML page to Jake Query

01:27.270 --> 01:28.710
and Javascript.

01:28.710 --> 01:32.000
So again this lecture really not going to talk much about javascript.

01:32.010 --> 01:36.360
Jake Query we're going to do that in future sections of the course but we will show you now how to connect

01:36.360 --> 01:39.790
the nation email page to some online hosted javascript.

01:39.810 --> 01:41.660
Jay queery codes.

01:41.730 --> 01:42.190
All right.

01:42.330 --> 01:46.050
Let's go ahead and get started by jumping straight to the editor in our browser.

01:46.050 --> 01:51.560
OK so here you have my editor open a have an H T M L file open and I've already linked that to the latest

01:51.570 --> 01:55.510
compile the modified C Ss of bootstrap.

01:55.590 --> 01:58.090
And here I have my body ready to go as well.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.510
So if I come over here to the project page it's link up.

02:01.560 --> 02:06.900
First let's check out how we can find more information about nav bars in the documentation of bootstrap.

02:06.900 --> 02:11.340
So if we come up here to bootstrap you can actually see there's a navigation bar already on that strip.

02:11.430 --> 02:16.230
You can see it says getting started the SS component so this is what a typical nav bar looks like.

02:16.230 --> 02:22.380
As you begin to explore the page and if you just come here to components will take the components page

02:22.800 --> 02:26.370
and down here there's a nav bar section so click on that.

02:26.450 --> 02:31.200
Now we can see some information about the fault nav bar and we can see that it requires javascript plugins

02:31.500 --> 02:37.350
for certain things such as collapsing and dropdown menu which are going to be talking about later on.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.670
So here is an example of an app bar.

02:39.690 --> 02:40.900
There is a brand.

02:40.900 --> 02:47.800
Some links a dropdown menu some search tools link an inlet dropdown menu on the right hand side and

02:47.890 --> 02:52.050
you can copy and paste this entire code if you want to take a look at all this.

02:52.190 --> 02:55.990
Instead all we're going to do is start off a building up the very basics and then we're going to add

02:55.990 --> 02:58.290
in components from the course notes.

02:58.360 --> 03:04.370
So let's show you how to just build a very basic nav bar in your age team file and then we'll start

03:04.370 --> 03:07.890
copying and pasting from the course notes and just a little bit.

03:07.900 --> 03:13.610
All right so the very first thing we do is called the Navteq that's the NIV tag that's going to be an

03:13.710 --> 03:18.090
team L that we can use to actually begin to build our NAV bar.

03:18.450 --> 03:29.410
And what we will do here is give it the class nav bar space nav bar dash default and we'll be adding

03:29.410 --> 03:33.890
a few things to that class later on to explore a couple of more things about it.

03:34.630 --> 03:42.890
And within this Navteq ongoing to create a divide so that it take a DIV tag here and give it the class

03:43.430 --> 03:51.980
nav bar dash header and this will actually be the header of the nav bar which is usually known as Brande's

03:51.980 --> 03:57.260
So this is where your company's brand or the main name of the Web site is going to go all the way on

03:57.260 --> 04:01.300
the left and inside of this we add in an anchor tag.

04:01.460 --> 04:02.730
There's an H ref there.

04:02.750 --> 04:06.620
And the reason for that is usually when you click on that link it takes you back to the home page which

04:06.620 --> 04:08.580
is leave that as a hash tag for now.

04:08.970 --> 04:11.930
Now we'll call it company.

04:12.120 --> 04:15.710
Let's save that refresh our page and see what it looks like.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.850
OK so here we see that we have company.

04:17.850 --> 04:22.440
However right now it doesn't look like the actual bootstrap company.

04:22.440 --> 04:28.350
So if we come back up here we can see with the nav bars if we scroll down to nav bar that brand usually

04:28.350 --> 04:29.730
looks stylized.

04:29.850 --> 04:32.700
It's come back here this looks just like normal the same links.

04:32.700 --> 04:41.640
So we end up doing is inside of the anchor tag add in a class called Nev bar dash brand.

04:41.650 --> 04:46.560
And hopefully you can begin to see that a lot of the classes start with the word nav bar.

04:46.570 --> 04:51.080
Second get a little confusing as far as trying to memorize these things which is why reference documentation

04:51.080 --> 04:52.760
is so important for the section.

04:52.850 --> 04:56.960
But now if I refresh I can see it looks like a typical company call.

04:57.290 --> 05:02.060
And as I mentioned here this Tref would usually take you to the home page you can really put in any

05:02.060 --> 05:02.830
link here.

05:03.140 --> 05:06.750
Just like for any other anchor tag so i can say HTP Yes.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.620
Coal and coal say W.W. Google dot com.

05:11.900 --> 05:15.480
Save that fire refresh this and click on this company.

05:15.530 --> 05:19.360
Now it takes me to Google dot com right now.

05:19.450 --> 05:24.850
We'll just leave this as hashtag and we'll discover later on how we can use the hash tag to link to

05:25.000 --> 05:26.080
different parts of the page.

05:27.250 --> 05:33.010
OK so we have a company brand over on the left now is discuss how to add in more components to the actual

05:33.070 --> 05:39.540
navigation bar so outside of that div I'm going to create an unordered list and an ordered list is how

05:39.540 --> 05:41.010
you add more things.

05:41.020 --> 05:51.110
This nav bar and to make it look good we give it the class nav space nav bar dash nav pretty repetitive.

05:51.120 --> 05:54.190
I know probably not the best name in scheme but that's how it goes.

05:54.360 --> 05:58.350
That's why you reference documentation for a lot of this in inciters unordered list.

05:58.350 --> 06:04.140
We put in list items and then we give an anchor calls where it just like the company or brand page we

06:04.140 --> 06:06.400
could give a link to another page.

06:06.410 --> 06:08.100
But right now we'll just keep it simple.

06:09.110 --> 06:11.160
We'll call this item 1.

06:11.260 --> 06:17.550
Put another one in here or tag and we'll call this one item to and let's see what they look like.

06:17.550 --> 06:23.160
Now as I refresh this page and there is item one item to their leaks so I could click on them to go

06:23.160 --> 06:28.610
somewhere but right now they don't really lead anywhere because a ref is just a hash tag.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.690
Now everything we've created so far is lined up to the left.

06:31.830 --> 06:37.890
If I want to add components to this nav bar that are lined up to the right I just add in the class Navarrete

06:37.920 --> 06:38.580
That's right.

06:38.580 --> 06:45.850
And let me show you by adding in a new unordered list and putting in the class same as last time nav

06:46.710 --> 06:48.490
nav bar.

06:48.570 --> 06:51.160
And then I add in here now.

06:51.190 --> 06:52.260
Barbash right.

06:53.160 --> 07:02.680
And then we can add in some more list items saying on the right save that refresh and we can see here

07:02.680 --> 07:08.090
we have on the right as they expand this I can see that it's kind of all the way to the right.

07:08.170 --> 07:15.170
What I can do is put everything inside a container tag to try to balance that out a little bit so create

07:15.190 --> 07:20.970
div container and this is something you'll find yourself doing often when you're working and bootstrap

07:20.970 --> 07:23.060
is kind of put in these container tags.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.920
To contain things save it.

07:27.010 --> 07:28.050
Refresh this.

07:28.090 --> 07:29.790
Now I can see this is nicely centered.

07:29.800 --> 07:34.450
So even as I expand the page from the left and the right it's a little more centered around the middle

07:34.450 --> 07:35.810
which is nice.

07:35.830 --> 07:36.790
OK.

07:36.940 --> 07:40.300
Make sure you don't actually wrap the entire nav bar on the container.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.460
Let me show you what happens if we do that.

07:42.470 --> 07:46.210
So if I wrap this entire nav you're in the container.

07:46.210 --> 07:50.590
What's going to happen is the entire nav bar is going to be centered and it will stretch across the

07:50.590 --> 07:51.720
entire page.

07:51.760 --> 07:56.380
So that's usually not what you want you want just the components themselves to be inside the container.

07:56.380 --> 07:59.110
So lets undo that.

07:59.190 --> 08:01.300
Let's do this.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.320
Great.

08:02.370 --> 08:04.850
So saving that refreshing here.

08:04.890 --> 08:06.580
Now we have the nav bar as ready to go.

08:07.880 --> 08:13.470
So as we continue I want to briefly discuss keeping a nav bar fixed to the top of the page.

08:13.580 --> 08:19.140
Even as you scroll down and in order to really show that we need to add some more material to this page.

08:19.250 --> 08:24.950
So I'm going to just copy and paste this from the notes but basically it's just a container class so

08:24.950 --> 08:26.600
let's copy and show it says.

08:26.780 --> 08:34.090
It's a container class with a Jumbotron inside of it says hello Lorem some lordship some other container

08:34.130 --> 08:35.910
more stuff Florham up some some.

08:35.920 --> 08:42.230
So if I save this refresh my page over here I can see that I can scroll up and down but you can see

08:42.230 --> 08:45.380
as I scroll down I eventually lose the nav bar.

08:45.390 --> 08:49.490
Now a lot of times that's how you want it you want it so that you scroll down the nav bar is no longer

08:49.490 --> 08:50.290
visible.

08:50.300 --> 08:56.000
Other times you may want the actual nav bar to scroll along with you as you go through the page.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.290
So let me add in a little more content here.

08:58.430 --> 09:02.430
We'll do one more alarm ipsum or at least two more so we can really get the effect.

09:03.310 --> 09:09.640
Refresh this page so you can see I have a little more to scroll down up and down with but the nav bar

09:09.730 --> 09:12.010
stays on the top and it disappears.

09:12.130 --> 09:16.810
If I want the nav bar to actually be fixed the top of the page even as I scroll down I just come back

09:16.810 --> 09:25.840
up here to where it says Nav. class nav bar space nav bar that default and I can add in this class call

09:25.840 --> 09:34.570
right here which is nav bar dash sixt dash top and this will fix it to the top of the page no matter

09:34.630 --> 09:35.260
if you scroll.

09:35.260 --> 09:37.060
So right now have an activity.

09:37.090 --> 09:38.350
Let's refresh this.

09:38.520 --> 09:42.610
And you can see already the change is kind of obvious the margin on the bottom went away.

09:42.610 --> 09:47.980
And as I scroll down the nav bar comes with me and the way to do that is just adding the bar at that

09:48.110 --> 09:51.400
fixed top and other quick note on the nav bar.

09:51.400 --> 09:57.730
Usually you will personally define the color using CSSA But if you want to stick to the basics but you

09:57.730 --> 10:08.100
don't like the light color there's a nav bar dash dash Inv. class you can add and here and this will

10:08.100 --> 10:11.560
essentially just make it dark and invert the colors.

10:11.820 --> 10:12.130
OK.

10:12.180 --> 10:13.890
So that's all I wanted to show right now.

10:14.070 --> 10:15.280
Let's take these out.

10:16.110 --> 10:17.770
Wups come back here.

10:18.780 --> 10:21.400
Like I said let's delete these.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.190
The fixed top and also the inverse.

10:23.180 --> 10:27.510
Call save it refresh.

10:27.580 --> 10:30.580
And let's also get rid of all this junk right here.

10:30.670 --> 10:33.240
Those last paragraphs are coming back down.

10:33.310 --> 10:35.430
Going to get rid of what we added here.

10:36.680 --> 10:38.710
Just so we can focus on the nav bar right now.

10:38.720 --> 10:39.810
So refreshing this.

10:39.830 --> 10:41.710
I only have my nav bar.

10:41.750 --> 10:42.270
OK.

10:42.560 --> 10:47.900
A big thing about now is bars especially a strap and also do a bit with the grid system is when you

10:47.900 --> 10:51.190
collapse it it actually forms what's known as the hamburger.

10:51.380 --> 10:56.750
And if I come back up here to the components page of the Get Bitstrips site you can see as I begin to

10:56.750 --> 10:59.580
collapse this down I get this little hamburger icon.

10:59.600 --> 11:03.860
The reason it's called Hamburger is basically you have two buns and a burger in the one and a click

11:03.860 --> 11:04.430
that.

11:04.430 --> 11:07.130
Then I get the rest of the left bar right now.

11:07.160 --> 11:14.750
You'll notice that even as I squeeze this browser all the way I don't get the actual collapse of the

11:14.750 --> 11:20.630
burger icon I just see the actual items beginning to reformat themselves.

11:20.660 --> 11:22.260
But I don't get the collapse.

11:22.280 --> 11:27.140
So let's show you how you can actually get that collapse in and to do that.

11:27.170 --> 11:31.340
I'm going to delete a lot of a lot of what we already have here.

11:31.670 --> 11:38.470
So let's get rid of these divs and I'm going to copy and paste from the notes and then walk through

11:38.470 --> 11:39.840
that.

11:39.860 --> 11:48.530
So it's copy and paste what's underneath the collapsible container here.

11:48.600 --> 11:53.190
So I just copy and paste it a lot of stuff so let's walk through it and explain says I refreshed this

11:53.190 --> 11:57.970
we can see we have this brand linked link and dropdown but the dropdown doesn't actually work yet.

11:58.030 --> 11:59.720
And we'll explain why in just a second.

12:00.570 --> 12:03.460
But expanding this let's actually show what I copied and paste it here.

12:03.540 --> 12:05.130
And this is all from the notes.

12:05.400 --> 12:11.070
So here I have my div class nav bar Hetter and we actually had that before.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.780
Then I added in a button right here.

12:13.830 --> 12:20.060
And basically we have this brand and toggle get grouped for what is essentially a bit immobile display.

12:20.260 --> 12:23.480
And this is going to be the code that actually creates the hamburger Rikon.

12:23.500 --> 12:29.080
So right now I have this button call and it says class nav bar toggle collapsed.

12:29.080 --> 12:36.190
So even with this already as a part of my nav bar as I begin to drop down I can see that it becomes

12:36.190 --> 12:41.610
the hamburger icon if I click on it nothing happens right now but I can see that it does collapse.

12:41.620 --> 12:43.440
Now that I've added those lines of code.

12:43.780 --> 12:50.150
So hamburger icon as I expand I get back the nav bar bullets explore what's actually going on here.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.420
So here's the code for the hamburger icon.

12:52.540 --> 12:56.130
And basically what it is it's a Spanish class.

12:56.260 --> 12:59.200
It says Esser only toggle navigation.

12:59.200 --> 13:05.450
And then we have these three calls for the cumbers and we can see as I collapse this I get those three

13:05.450 --> 13:09.220
icon bars I can add in more here.

13:10.380 --> 13:11.940
So let's make that for now.

13:11.940 --> 13:18.690
And if I refresh this I can see actually get four icon bars in if I keep going if this add in the bunch

13:18.690 --> 13:23.260
more refresh I can see him adding in more icon bars here.

13:23.490 --> 13:26.880
However it's typical just to use three.

13:26.920 --> 13:29.050
So let's save it with three.

13:29.140 --> 13:32.690
Refresh the page and we can see you have the three that little hamburger icon.

13:32.740 --> 13:35.410
OK so this is the actual code for the hamburger icon.

13:35.440 --> 13:40.720
Again just using the class icon bar and then toggling of navigation.

13:40.810 --> 13:49.330
So that's all inside this button for the button class is nav bar dash toggle space collapse and there's

13:49.330 --> 13:54.200
some more information here that usually just be copying and pasting.

13:54.200 --> 13:54.480
All right.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.040
So that's all under the F var header.

13:57.260 --> 14:03.130
And then anything inside of click collapse nav bar that collapse goes into the hamburger.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.090
And basically what that means is this.

14:05.090 --> 14:12.560
So anything any unordered list that you add in that's inside of a div with this class to collapse nav

14:12.560 --> 14:17.760
bar bash collapse is going to be collapsed into hamburger.

14:18.140 --> 14:21.590
And she what I mean by that is let's add in an ordered list.

14:21.590 --> 14:22.690
Outside of that.

14:22.830 --> 14:25.290
So I'm going to add an unordered list.

14:25.490 --> 14:29.860
And just like we did last time at the very beginning we'll give it the class

14:33.780 --> 14:38.910
nav bar or nav space nav bar dash nav

14:41.810 --> 14:46.550
and we'll say something like Hello.

14:46.660 --> 14:48.070
So let's save this.

14:48.070 --> 14:51.770
And you notice Hello here no longer goes into the hamburger.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.020
So as I expand this I see brands.

14:54.040 --> 14:54.730
Hello.

14:54.830 --> 14:57.460
Link link and then a dropdown menu.

14:57.460 --> 15:04.200
Then as I begin to collapse this everything that was inside of this div class had collapsed nav bar

15:04.220 --> 15:10.730
that collapse went into the hamburger whatever was not inside of that which in this case was this halo

15:11.450 --> 15:17.090
happens to not go into the hamburger and basically details the same behavior we saw last Tyne-Wear just

15:17.090 --> 15:20.390
get squeezed down but doesn't actually go into the hamburger.

15:20.840 --> 15:21.040
All right.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.180
So that's what that class is doing.

15:23.450 --> 15:26.660
And usually you're going to put almost everything inside the collapse.

15:26.660 --> 15:31.330
Now if Mark collapse unless it's really so important they don't want it to go in this hamburger class.

15:31.340 --> 15:32.360
But it's really common.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.180
Just put everything inside the collapse.

15:34.220 --> 15:40.190
Especially for mobile viewers the last thing we need to do however to actually complete this is if we

15:40.190 --> 15:48.350
expand back or menu here and we can't refresh this well let's save this and then refresh as we see we

15:48.350 --> 15:52.110
have the two links and then the dropdown menu but the drop down menu is not working.

15:52.110 --> 15:56.040
And we also noticed that when we collapse this the dropdown menu here wasn't working.

15:56.180 --> 16:02.690
And that's because we actually need calls to query in javascript to make those functionalities work.

16:02.990 --> 16:06.710
And the way we're going to do that is in our case we're just going to copy and paste from the notes

16:07.100 --> 16:10.490
and later on we'll show you how to actually grab stuff from Jake Query.

16:10.500 --> 16:16.580
So either go to code that J.Crew dot com to grab this or just copy and paste it from the notes but we're

16:16.580 --> 16:21.750
going to do in our case is copy and paste this and put it at the very bottom.

16:22.540 --> 16:25.120
Of our body call right here.

16:25.120 --> 16:33.380
And what this is doing is copying and pasting a script call to Jake Query and this one is copying and

16:33.380 --> 16:36.510
pasting the bootstrap Javascript.

16:36.800 --> 16:41.510
And if you went back to the very first page of javascript you probably noticed that there were some

16:41.510 --> 16:47.900
calls there that you could have also copied and pasted so if bootstrap went to download bootstrap as

16:47.900 --> 16:54.950
we scroll down here we saw there was a modified CSSA but there was also this bootstrap Javascript.

16:54.980 --> 16:58.100
So that's what the second line is right here.

16:58.100 --> 17:04.020
This bootstrap javascript that's what I'm copying and pasting from this other line is code that J.

17:04.020 --> 17:05.030
Queried dot com.

17:05.030 --> 17:07.200
That's actually a link to Jay queried.

17:07.270 --> 17:11.600
Yes which we're going to talk about much more later when we talk about Jay query and how it connects

17:11.600 --> 17:12.200
to Django.

17:12.200 --> 17:17.960
But right now you can just copy and paste these two lines from the notes save this and then refresh

17:18.230 --> 17:18.960
our page.

17:19.070 --> 17:21.860
And we should see now that the dropdown menu is actually work.

17:21.860 --> 17:24.200
So here we have dropdown items.

17:24.410 --> 17:29.900
And as we collapse this we see the hamburger icon I can click on it and now everything is working.

17:29.990 --> 17:30.440
All right.

17:30.610 --> 17:34.970
And if you want more details on how to actually add in your components the dropdown you can there check

17:34.970 --> 17:36.820
the documentation which is really good.

17:36.860 --> 17:41.240
Or just check out the notes and you can see here that's basically just another unordered list with the

17:41.240 --> 17:43.410
class dropdown menu.

17:43.700 --> 17:46.850
And then you can add in links list items there.

17:46.850 --> 17:47.470
OK.

17:47.720 --> 17:48.720
Thanks a lot everybody.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.230
If you have any questions feel free to post in the Q&amp;A forums.

17:51.260 --> 17:55.140
I know this was a lot of stuff especially if these kind of goofy class names.

17:55.270 --> 18:00.470
But I want you to really get out of this is being able to reference the documentation for nav bars and

18:00.470 --> 18:02.330
know what's possible if bootstrap.

18:02.390 --> 18:04.170
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.

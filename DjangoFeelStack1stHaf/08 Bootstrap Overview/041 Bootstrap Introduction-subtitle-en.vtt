00:04.910 --> 00:07.100
Hello everyone and welcome back.

00:07.100 --> 00:09.470
Welcome to the bootstrap section of the course.

00:09.500 --> 00:14.690
Bootstrap is a very common framework to use for front and web development and it's actually going to

00:14.690 --> 00:18.830
help us save a lot of time from dealing with CSSA manually.

00:18.890 --> 00:24.560
But first we need to ask ourselves what is a framework what makes it different than just a library or

00:24.560 --> 00:26.050
some sort of package.

00:26.420 --> 00:29.330
Well a framework has a couple of key qualities.

00:29.330 --> 00:35.720
Some of those qualities are inversion of control meaning you're giving up control to the framework and

00:35.720 --> 00:38.910
the framework is going to have some sort of default behavior.

00:39.050 --> 00:42.100
And it's a non modifiable framework code.

00:42.540 --> 00:48.080
And basically what this means is the framework is going to be defining the rules for you to follow not

00:48.080 --> 00:49.010
the other way around.

00:49.010 --> 00:55.470
Usually we've been seeing ourselves write some code defining the rules and then executing the code.

00:55.580 --> 01:00.700
Here the framework is going to tell you what the rules are as far as how you can manipulate the code.

01:00.740 --> 01:06.380
So there's an inversion of control there between what we're used to and we'll get more use of this idea

01:06.650 --> 01:14.220
of what a framework is when we reach Django because Django itself is a web framework for Python now

01:14.250 --> 01:19.500
a large part of bootstrap is not memorization but really understanding how to reference the documentation

01:19.830 --> 01:25.200
for your own use cases and this section will focus on some of the more common use cases of bootstrap.

01:25.290 --> 01:31.170
But the main thing to get across here is your ability to reference the documentation understand what

01:31.170 --> 01:36.710
you need to get out of it and then apply it to your own web site before we begin though let's talk about

01:36.920 --> 01:40.670
bootstrap version 3 versus version 4.

01:40.850 --> 01:46.490
So bootstrap 4 is currently still in development at the time of this filming and will be released soon.

01:46.490 --> 01:51.710
Right now it's an alpha so likely beta will come out after that and then after that we'll get some sort

01:51.710 --> 01:53.840
of first initial release.

01:53.840 --> 01:59.080
Now it may already be released by the time you're viewing this video but if it hasn't yet bootstrap

01:59.090 --> 02:04.070
actually makes it really easy for me to use the alpha version or the beta version that that's out by

02:04.070 --> 02:08.930
the time you're watching this right now so you can actually quickly and easily use whatever the current

02:08.930 --> 02:10.370
version of bootstrap for is.

02:10.550 --> 02:16.950
While bootstrap theory is still the main release for our level of use the differences between version

02:16.950 --> 02:20.070
3 and version 4 won't really be apparent to us.

02:20.070 --> 02:25.590
We're not going to dive so deep into bootstrap that these differences are even going to be on our radar

02:26.490 --> 02:30.930
while version 4 is a major rewrite from Version 3.

02:31.020 --> 02:34.810
We are really not going to dive deep enough to notice any of the differences.

02:34.920 --> 02:40.140
A few of the differences are things such as panels are now being replaced by something called cards

02:40.500 --> 02:42.390
larger default font sizes.

02:42.390 --> 02:43.990
There's a new grids here.

02:44.160 --> 02:49.440
The use of flex box throughout the version for framework and a move from less to SAS.

02:49.440 --> 02:54.390
Now a lot of these terms if you're new to bootstrap and to see assess probably don't mean anything to

02:54.390 --> 02:54.790
you.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.930
And you have no idea what I'm referencing here.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.310
If that's the case really don't worry about it.

02:59.310 --> 03:04.260
We're not going to dive into bootstrap so deep in this course nor will we need to that we need to understand

03:04.260 --> 03:08.300
all these differences between version 3 and version 4.

03:08.300 --> 03:12.170
So again the most important thing to get out of this section of the course is the ability to reference

03:12.170 --> 03:13.970
the bootstrap documentation.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.050
So let's explore the documentation and see some examples of what bootstrap actually looks like.

03:18.080 --> 03:23.480
The documentation is amazing it's full of examples that makes it really easy to copy and paste and modify

03:23.480 --> 03:24.890
in your own code.

03:24.890 --> 03:27.610
Let's go to get bootstrap dot com.

03:27.620 --> 03:33.260
OK so here Eric get bootstrapped dot com you'll see a little banner here that says Ayyash bootstrap

03:33.260 --> 03:33.950
4 is coming.

03:33.950 --> 03:38.870
You can click on that if you want more information on Version 4 but you'll notice that there's actually

03:38.870 --> 03:42.410
links on quickly getting started with a version for right now.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.450
It's in alpha.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.180
So who knows.

03:44.180 --> 03:49.700
By the time you're viewing this video it may already be in beta or it may already be on its first release.

03:49.700 --> 03:54.620
But let's go back and work of the current release which is right now version 3 and again for our use

03:54.620 --> 03:55.180
cases.

03:55.190 --> 03:57.380
Either one will work fine for you.

03:57.380 --> 04:02.850
So if you click on dialup bootstrap it takes you to this getting started link and there's essentially

04:02.850 --> 04:04.770
two ways to use bootstrap.

04:04.770 --> 04:10.980
As far as in conjunction with pure web application you can either download the source code itself which

04:10.980 --> 04:18.360
is going to be the font files the source less some javascript etc. or you can actually just use what's

04:18.360 --> 04:26.270
known as a Cdn a C The n is a content delivery network and you can think of it as essential to working

04:26.270 --> 04:29.840
in a really similar manner to how we use google fonts.

04:29.840 --> 04:37.600
So Google fonts API or the font library that or essentially Ladas to copy and paste a CDN link into

04:37.600 --> 04:42.380
free html file and then it just got the files over the Internet and that's basically what we can do

04:42.380 --> 04:43.050
here.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.470
We can see the links here.

04:45.220 --> 04:51.930
That allow us to copy and paste into our HMO file to actually leak to boot strap which is great.

04:52.030 --> 04:56.950
You can see here there's a stylesheet as well as some compile them in a fight Javascript.

04:57.120 --> 05:01.330
And we'll be talking about this when we actually open up the editor and start dealing with bootstrap.

05:01.330 --> 05:04.240
But essentially we're going to be copying these links.

05:04.240 --> 05:10.420
You can also manually download the links and then save them onto your computer and link to the local

05:10.420 --> 05:11.770
reference on your computer.

05:11.920 --> 05:15.480
But that just is a bunch of downloaded files that we don't really need.

05:15.580 --> 05:20.950
If you're trying to make your application self-hosted without any internet maybe you're going on a train

05:20.950 --> 05:24.580
ride or something you want to play around a bootstrap then you will have to download it manually that

05:24.580 --> 05:25.140
way.

05:25.180 --> 05:28.600
But if you have access to the internet then you can just use CDN.

05:28.780 --> 05:32.060
And if you're watching video then it's most likely they do have access to the Internet.

05:32.340 --> 05:32.950
OK.

05:33.400 --> 05:38.350
So coming back up here I want to explore the documentation a little more if you need to click on getting

05:38.350 --> 05:38.860
started.

05:38.890 --> 05:44.080
You'll take it to this link and you'll notice that beyond the download there's just basic information

05:44.080 --> 05:45.610
like what's included.

05:45.610 --> 05:48.760
Which is right here is what pre-compiled nuestra looks like.

05:48.790 --> 05:54.570
It's really just a bunch of the SS files bunch font files and then two javascript files here.

05:54.830 --> 06:00.370
There's the bootstrap source code and then if you keep going down there is just basic information basic

06:00.370 --> 06:01.890
template information etc..

06:01.960 --> 06:06.260
And then there's some examples so here are some examples of what the framework looks like.

06:07.270 --> 06:09.790
Click on these to open up in New tabs.

06:09.820 --> 06:14.100
Hopefully you can begin to see an idea of what bootstrap actually does.

06:14.100 --> 06:20.000
So here are some very simple templates of what bootstrap looks like.

06:20.210 --> 06:22.190
So you can see there's a nav bar here.

06:22.260 --> 06:25.860
There is some sort of theme example and then there are some buttons here.

06:26.850 --> 06:29.820
There's also the grid template which we'll be talking about later on.

06:29.920 --> 06:35.820
There's a Jumbotron template there is a narrow template again if a jumbo tron here.

06:35.900 --> 06:40.100
And then there's a nut bar template and we're going to be walking through a lot of these things throughout

06:40.100 --> 06:41.070
the section of the course.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.170
Jumbotron snack bars grids.

06:43.280 --> 06:47.210
Those are all really common things that we are going to cover with bootstrap.

06:47.380 --> 06:54.730
But for specific things if you scroll back up here and click on components this will take you through

06:54.730 --> 06:58.810
basically all the components at CSA or excuse me bootstrap has to offer.

06:58.810 --> 07:04.230
So if you want more details on for instance a nav bar you just click here on the side the nav bar and

07:04.240 --> 07:08.470
has really great documentation I'll tell you what the default nav bar it looks like and that it has

07:08.470 --> 07:09.950
tons of example code.

07:10.150 --> 07:12.400
So this is an example of what this nav bar looks like.

07:12.400 --> 07:16.570
So you can see has a dropdown menu and will be discussing what this looks like later on.

07:16.600 --> 07:21.430
And that also has a code for it so you can always reference the code as well as what the code is going

07:21.430 --> 07:22.060
to look like.

07:22.060 --> 07:26.610
So if you want a brand image in your now bar it shows an example what that looks like and shows the

07:26.610 --> 07:28.570
example what that code looks like.

07:28.570 --> 07:30.780
You want forms input forms you know.

07:30.820 --> 07:34.180
Or maybe a search button shows you what that looks like as well.

07:34.940 --> 07:40.340
So you keep going down here maybe you want to check out how progress bars work with bootstrap.

07:40.490 --> 07:45.770
Well you just click on bootstrap here on progress bars and you can see the basic example of what a progress

07:45.770 --> 07:47.090
bar looks like.

07:47.180 --> 07:48.950
And it shows you the code for as well.

07:48.950 --> 07:53.990
Then if you want to label it also shows you that you can see that bootstrap is basically just a bunch

07:54.050 --> 07:57.990
of predefined CSSA styles that are really going to help you.

07:58.040 --> 08:02.030
And they each have their own class and we're going to discuss how to actually use these and a lot more

08:02.030 --> 08:03.650
detail in future lectures.

08:03.650 --> 08:08.240
What I want to do is get out this lecture is the fact that you can reference basically anything you

08:08.240 --> 08:12.370
want about this strap and C example code for as well as what it looks like.

08:12.430 --> 08:14.530
All on the documentation page.

08:14.540 --> 08:15.040
OK.

08:15.290 --> 08:19.670
So the very first thing we're going to be discussing we talk about bootstrap is how to use these buttons

08:19.800 --> 08:24.020
these really simple buttons and you'll see that they actually already have classes defined to them so

08:24.020 --> 08:30.410
very basic examples look like this lift left middle right but they'll also have their own colored classes

08:30.410 --> 08:32.980
which are going to be exploring later on.

08:32.990 --> 08:33.820
All right.

08:33.980 --> 08:34.760
So go ahead.

08:34.760 --> 08:38.920
I encourage you to just jump around the documentation and check it out.

08:39.050 --> 08:42.440
But coming up next we're going to talk a lot more about bootstrap and buttons.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.340
Thanks everyone.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.390
I'll see you at the next lecture.

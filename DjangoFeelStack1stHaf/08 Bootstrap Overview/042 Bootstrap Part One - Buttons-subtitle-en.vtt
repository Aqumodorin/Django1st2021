00:05.140 --> 00:08.620
Hello everyone and welcome to part one of the Bitstrips section of the course.

00:09.530 --> 00:12.620
A key feature of bootstrap arts default classes.

00:12.620 --> 00:17.490
You can call these classes to quickly and easily build good looking features for your web application.

00:18.330 --> 00:22.910
We're going to be going over button classes as well as the container and Jumbotron classes.

00:22.920 --> 00:27.070
First though we start off by showing how to connect an html file to bootstrap itself.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.170
Let's get started.

00:28.200 --> 00:32.940
We're going to open up my text editor toonies HTML file as well as my browser and Cziko get bootstrapped

00:32.940 --> 00:33.950
dot com again.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.310
Let's get started.

00:35.310 --> 00:39.090
All right so here you have my editor open as well as my browser.

00:39.150 --> 00:39.930
I have an empty page.

00:39.950 --> 00:42.150
You know files linked to my browser.

00:42.150 --> 00:47.230
Let's get started by showing you how it actually connected nature T.M. content to bootstrap.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.050
So I just type.

00:48.060 --> 00:54.990
H Tim Allen got the basics going and if you go to get bootstrap dot com and click on download bootstrap

00:55.990 --> 00:58.350
will eventually take you to this getting started Ted.

00:58.730 --> 01:00.290
And you basically have two options here.

01:00.290 --> 01:06.650
One is to download the bootstrap files yourself and then link them locally on your computer so you'll

01:06.650 --> 01:11.650
be downloading a CSX file and then you can link that locally just as we've done for other CSSA files.

01:11.780 --> 01:17.270
Or you can just use the Cdn which basically is an online host for you to connect to.

01:17.420 --> 01:23.600
So you can just grab this link right here and you can grab all of these if you want but we're keeping

01:23.600 --> 01:27.310
it simple so we'll just grab this right now which is the only link we need.

01:28.650 --> 01:34.050
For this particular lecture and if you scroll down you'll actually see there is pre-compiled bootstrap

01:34.100 --> 01:35.150
bootstrap source code.

01:35.160 --> 01:39.600
But keep scrolling down there's a basic template so usually will probably end up starting with this

01:39.600 --> 01:44.340
entire basic template which includes things such as Jay queery and some Javascript code.

01:44.460 --> 01:46.780
But right now we don't know enough about that to actually use it.

01:46.800 --> 01:52.260
So we're going to use the very first link we saw here which is the latest compile and a minute fight.

01:52.280 --> 01:58.160
SS So if we zoom in a little more this is the link I'm using.

01:58.160 --> 01:58.430
All right.

01:58.460 --> 01:59.930
So that's ready to go.

02:00.140 --> 02:01.510
Let's actually test it out.

02:02.420 --> 02:10.200
By creating a heading one in the body will say bootstrap exclamation mark.

02:10.410 --> 02:16.320
And let's actually comment out of control or command forward slash the link to that style sheet just

02:16.320 --> 02:17.250
to make sure it's working.

02:17.250 --> 02:20.650
So if I refresh this project that it's CML it's linked to it.

02:20.670 --> 02:21.850
I see bootstrap.

02:22.080 --> 02:29.540
Now if I turn the link back on and uncomment it and refresh noticed what happens to the font the font

02:29.540 --> 02:35.660
changes to boot straps default font and that is one quick and easy way you can tell if bootstrap is

02:35.660 --> 02:37.160
successfully working.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.370
Keep in mind you do need an internet connection for this to work.

02:40.370 --> 02:43.640
If not you'll have to download the files manually.

02:43.640 --> 02:46.810
Either way you're going to need the internet connection at some point in time.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.390
But if you're watching that video it's probably because you have an internet connection.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.650
Let's discuss a container class.

02:52.990 --> 02:59.870
So I'm going to create a DIV tag and right now I'll leave it class list but I'm going to add heading

02:59.870 --> 03:00.860
one that says

03:03.750 --> 03:04.900
Hello world.

03:05.130 --> 03:06.270
Exclamation mark.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.420
Save it refresh.

03:08.480 --> 03:13.550
And I can see that my hello world heading is actually right against the left hand side of my browser

03:13.550 --> 03:17.430
so as expand my browser it's still there on the left hand side.

03:17.520 --> 03:23.370
What I can do to try to center a little bit off that left hand browser is put it in what's known as

03:23.370 --> 03:25.910
a container class.

03:26.150 --> 03:30.410
And what's really nice about bootstrap it basically comes with a bunch of predefined classes free to

03:30.410 --> 03:35.330
easily call in your code and you don't have to worry about memorizing all these class names are going

03:35.330 --> 03:39.140
to be seeing the main thing you have to learn out of this section of course is how to reference the

03:39.140 --> 03:42.570
documentation which will be showing you when we talk about buttons.

03:42.770 --> 03:47.840
But notice the hello world is now in the class container so if I refresh this I see that it's centered

03:47.840 --> 03:48.800
and down a little bit.

03:48.830 --> 03:52.560
So basically just affected the margin spacing.

03:52.610 --> 03:57.980
You can see here as I expand this window or as I begin to collapse it more it's to try that it's best

03:57.980 --> 04:04.070
to say a little more centered or a certain distance off of the left hand side of the browser which is

04:04.070 --> 04:05.750
exactly what we want.

04:05.790 --> 04:10.190
So delete this now and continue on.

04:10.610 --> 04:15.020
OK now that we've explored the container class a little bit it's going to be something we explore a

04:15.020 --> 04:20.210
lot more as we continue through bootstrap it's time to talk about the button classes that are available

04:20.210 --> 04:26.950
to him bootstrap if you come to the link at the strip that com slash CSSA which if I expand this browser

04:27.250 --> 04:33.330
you'll see here it's in the top nav bar you can just click on CSSA there is a right hand side column

04:33.340 --> 04:40.420
here we have some sections and click on buttons and basically bootstrap comes with some button classes

04:40.420 --> 04:44.620
that you can easily call and you can call him on three separate types of tags you can call it on an

04:44.620 --> 04:47.410
anchor tag rumor that's a tag of a link to it.

04:47.410 --> 04:51.190
You can call it on a button tag something we haven't actually talked about yet but we're going to be

04:51.190 --> 04:55.670
doing in the section right now and in impot tags something we've used for forms.

04:55.710 --> 04:59.520
We'll actually be discussing forms in the next lecture.

04:59.540 --> 05:04.750
So right now let's explore using the button tech which we haven't actually seen it in action.

05:04.750 --> 05:09.280
Now the button tag basically allows us to create a button scroll back down to where we had the buttons

05:11.150 --> 05:17.870
OK I just scrolled back down to the buttons and let's add a button to our H.T. Malca.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.550
So I will say button and we'll keep the type button and name button to be the default there and let's

05:24.550 --> 05:29.580
say something like click on that button will refresh and.

05:29.740 --> 05:34.210
Now you can see we have a button here that I can click but really nothing happens.

05:34.270 --> 05:39.670
And the reason we really talk about Button tags and H.M.S. the course or the CSSA section the course

05:39.970 --> 05:44.760
is because before we know javascript there's not much we can actually do of these buttons themselves.

05:44.770 --> 05:49.530
Right now we're learning about them because of the typical styling choices you bootstrap on them.

05:49.660 --> 05:54.940
But keep in mind we won't actually be able to really activate anything upon a click of a button.

05:55.270 --> 06:00.550
Besides a simple connection to another Web site we can do that also if an anchor tag.

06:00.610 --> 06:04.840
It's not until we reach javascript or we're actually going to be clicking buttons and making things

06:04.840 --> 06:07.140
change on the web page.

06:07.180 --> 06:07.890
All right.

06:08.020 --> 06:09.650
So here's my button Ted.

06:09.670 --> 06:14.800
Now let's discuss bootstrap classes with buttons and this is basically the way you're going to be using

06:14.860 --> 06:16.510
the bootstrap documentation.

06:16.540 --> 06:21.440
I keep stressing that documentation is really important with bootstrap and I'm going to show you why.

06:21.670 --> 06:24.340
So he keeps scrolling down and buttons and you see here we have options.

06:24.340 --> 06:31.090
So these are available buttons that quickly create a style button and there's basically just a couple

06:31.090 --> 06:37.610
default button types there's default primary success in forewarning danger and the way you utilize these

06:37.610 --> 06:38.780
classes with bootstrap.

06:38.780 --> 06:45.530
And we utilize bootstrap in general just by specifying class is equal to.

06:45.630 --> 06:47.760
And then you specify whatever class you want.

06:47.760 --> 06:52.980
So let's say if we come back here to our project they smell we want to turn this click button into the

06:52.980 --> 06:55.230
style of a success button.

06:55.230 --> 06:56.320
So we just come here.

06:56.340 --> 07:01.450
Look at success and see it's beauty and space beauty and success.

07:01.590 --> 07:08.740
So there's a button or between the success save it.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.560
Come back here refresh.

07:10.690 --> 07:12.910
And now it looks like a success button.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.210
Great.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.520
So coming down we can keep saying that there's more stuff we can add.

07:17.540 --> 07:22.070
So fancy larger or smaller buttons you can continue to add for more classes.

07:22.070 --> 07:25.540
So now it can add PTEN dash Elgie.

07:25.940 --> 07:32.360
So let's do that I'll say between dash Elgie to make that into a large button.

07:32.380 --> 07:37.730
So I come back here refreshed we can see that the bunds gotten a little bit larger.

07:37.790 --> 07:44.860
We can continue them see things such as active state so benzyl appear pressed when active we can also

07:45.240 --> 07:48.030
do things such as make it disabled state.

07:48.030 --> 07:54.330
So if we want to make it look disabled all I have to do is say disabled is equal to the Seybold So it's

07:54.330 --> 07:58.700
copy and paste that.

07:58.800 --> 08:04.660
And that's actually another parameter property of this button tag will it save it and it lets actually

08:04.660 --> 08:07.300
create another button so we can compare it to.

08:07.370 --> 08:12.410
So I will create one button just copy and paste this.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.780
It has disabled on.

08:13.860 --> 08:28.380
Let's say this is I am on the bottom one will say disabled and the one of has I am on we are going to

08:28.410 --> 08:34.810
delete this disabled marker on it or the Seybold parameter will save it refresh here.

08:34.810 --> 08:39.660
Now you can see the I am on I can click on that and hover over the Seybold Google Chrome this let me

08:39.660 --> 08:40.530
click on it.

08:40.530 --> 08:43.140
It shows that nice little icon it says this is not clickable.

08:45.070 --> 08:50.770
And there's a quick note you can always override these default style so maybe you like the success button

08:50.800 --> 08:53.560
that you want to make the text a different color.

08:53.560 --> 09:01.210
All you have to do is in your CSSA file grab the T.N. between that access call it your own class and

09:01.210 --> 09:05.460
your CSSA file and you could overwrite individual aspects of it.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.940
It will override everything.

09:06.940 --> 09:10.710
It'll just overwrite whatever aspects that you want to overwrite.

09:10.720 --> 09:15.160
So if you want to overwrite the text color a text background you could do that yourself just with your

09:15.160 --> 09:18.870
C Ss and just calling this class a success.

09:18.910 --> 09:20.240
You could do that yourself.

09:20.380 --> 09:21.020
All right.

09:21.190 --> 09:26.740
Now it's finally talk quickly about the Jumbotron which is something we'll be using a little bit throughout

09:26.740 --> 09:27.620
this course.

09:28.030 --> 09:34.000
So a view with the Jumbotron actually looks like we're going to hop back over to the get bootstrap page

09:34.060 --> 09:40.270
and let me expand this so it can see the nav bar and I'm going to click on components and components

09:40.360 --> 09:46.620
as we scroll down we'll see a bunch components are going to talk about later on such as nav bars labels

09:46.630 --> 09:51.940
stuff like that but you keep scrolling down you'll see the Jumbotron component and we see that Jumbotron

09:51.940 --> 09:57.550
is basically a lightweight flexible component that can extend the interview port to showcase key content

09:57.580 --> 10:01.900
so you can think of this almost like a landing page and this is the most basic Jumbotron.

10:01.910 --> 10:02.920
It has some large file.

10:02.920 --> 10:09.120
Here are some large Hedding some simple hero unit whatever and then a button there so we can actually

10:09.120 --> 10:10.350
just copy and paste this

10:14.220 --> 10:17.770
and put it into our ECMO

10:21.030 --> 10:22.200
So we say hello world.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.580
I thought that is the paragraph.

10:23.580 --> 10:26.370
So I'll say something like this is the

10:29.100 --> 10:31.620
paragraph save that.

10:31.640 --> 10:36.390
And let's actually see this now on our project page refresh what we see here.

10:36.410 --> 10:39.090
Now we have an H T M L Jumbotron.

10:39.110 --> 10:44.180
Usually however you're going to want this Jumbotron to be within a container so it doesn't take up this

10:44.180 --> 10:46.060
entire page.

10:46.260 --> 10:55.450
Well we will do then is put this inside of a container class grabbed this entire jumbo division or the

10:55.450 --> 10:59.600
Vider there stick it inside save it.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.430
And I want to refresh.

11:01.430 --> 11:08.840
I can see that it's basically centered like it was here on this page and that's really the main idea

11:08.840 --> 11:10.600
of bootstrap going to come over here.

11:10.610 --> 11:11.710
See what you need.

11:11.720 --> 11:16.820
So if you want to know how to use an alert you just come here to the olor and you can read the examples

11:16.820 --> 11:20.740
here you see here there's a class alert roll etc..

11:21.200 --> 11:26.660
So so far we learn about where the basic button classes which you can always check out by coming to

11:26.660 --> 11:32.930
the CSSA page and then clicking on buttons and you can see the various button tasks that are available

11:32.930 --> 11:34.180
to you.

11:34.280 --> 11:38.270
Then we also learn about the container class which you didn't think of as just basically centering stuff

11:38.330 --> 11:39.290
on your page.

11:39.290 --> 11:41.800
And then we also learned about the Jumbotron class.

11:41.810 --> 11:44.690
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

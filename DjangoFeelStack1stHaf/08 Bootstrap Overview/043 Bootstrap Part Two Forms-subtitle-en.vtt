Hello everyone and welcome to part two of the Bitstrips section we're going to be discussing forms.

00:11.250 --> 00:15.020
A quick note before we actually begin to dive straight into forms of bootstrap.

00:15.060 --> 00:17.910
I want to talk about bootstrap in general for just a little bit.

00:17.910 --> 00:21.050
Many students get intimidated by bootstrap when they first approach it.

00:21.090 --> 00:25.210
They think they need to memorize all the classics that we cover in the section of the course.

00:25.380 --> 00:27.230
Now that's actually certainly not the case.

00:27.240 --> 00:31.950
You want to think of this section more as a guide to the documentation and what's really possible bootstrap

00:32.190 --> 00:34.930
not as an overview of things that you need it memorize.

00:35.430 --> 00:39.960
Even the people who work bootstrap often or everyday are going to you're referencing the documentation

00:39.960 --> 00:40.540
a lot.

00:40.740 --> 00:45.570
Well we really want a master here is the skill of gathering and applying information not just memorizing

00:45.570 --> 00:47.660
information.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.680
Now it's continue on talking about forms.

00:49.690 --> 00:52.510
So bootstrap comes with many default classes for forms.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.920
There's two really important ones that are going to be covering here.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.480
And one of the first ones are going to cover is a class called form group.

00:58.480 --> 01:03.040
So let's explore the various form components that we can use of bootstrap and we're going to be referencing

01:03.040 --> 01:04.630
the course notes quite a bit.

01:04.630 --> 01:09.850
So what I would suggest you do is to open up the part to underscore forms that each T.M. file that's

01:09.850 --> 01:11.430
under the bootstrap folder.

01:11.720 --> 01:15.550
OK let's jump straight to our browser and to her editor to get started.

01:15.550 --> 01:21.760
All right so here you have my editor open as well as my browser and if I refresh major T.M. here right

01:21.760 --> 01:27.190
now I have it linked to my browser this extra Mells linked in it also already has the link to the CD

01:27.400 --> 01:28.930
version of bootstrap.

01:28.950 --> 01:31.590
There is an empty body to get started.

01:31.620 --> 01:34.470
I just want to point out where we can find a lot of this information.

01:34.470 --> 01:39.990
If you go to get bootstrapped dot com click on the CSX tab and then click down here where it says forms.

01:40.230 --> 01:46.370
They'll take you down to a basic example of forms and we can see here that we need to wrap labels or

01:46.380 --> 01:50.520
controls in a dot form group for optimum spacing.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.550
And what it says there it's just trying to tell you that it's a class.

01:53.550 --> 01:57.360
Remember we're dealing of CSSA we reference classes with that period or Dopp.

01:57.390 --> 02:01.710
So when you actually type in the class it will just be formed up that group you want to actually have

02:01.710 --> 02:02.730
that dot there.

02:03.030 --> 02:07.770
So let's see this example explore a little bit and see what happens when you wrap everything with a

02:07.770 --> 02:11.230
form group class so I will copy this.

02:11.430 --> 02:14.380
And it's actually a really nice copy to clipboard button there.

02:14.400 --> 02:20.880
You can just use and I'm going to paste this into my system file save it and then check it out here

02:20.880 --> 02:21.840
in my browser.

02:22.910 --> 02:26.100
And we can see right now it stretches from end to end on everything.

02:26.270 --> 02:28.860
So what I can do to organize this.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.270
So it looks a little nicer.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.840
Put it all in a container class and that's something we to be doing.

02:32.840 --> 02:37.470
Often when we use bootstrap as put everything in different container divs.

02:37.870 --> 02:38.950
So let's paste that there.

02:38.960 --> 02:39.920
The closing tab.

02:40.040 --> 02:47.500
And then grab this entire form and just put it a little more or indented a little more.

02:47.500 --> 02:47.710
All right.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.140
Now that everything is in a container class.

02:49.140 --> 02:52.160
When I refresh you can see it's a little nicely centered.

02:52.270 --> 02:53.500
So so far it's looking pretty good.

02:53.500 --> 02:57.910
We have our e-mail input our password input and we could see some more advanced inputs things such as

02:58.180 --> 02:59.290
a Choose file inputs.

02:59.290 --> 03:04.000
If I click on Choose file we can see that it pops up something for me to choose File.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Now right now we actually can't do anything of this because we haven't learned the backend technologies

03:08.000 --> 03:11.530
such as jingo to actually accept that file and do something with it.

03:11.600 --> 03:15.530
Here we can see just a checkbox and then the submit button.

03:15.550 --> 03:20.950
Now the class I want to talk about with forms is this class form croupe and what the class form group

03:20.950 --> 03:27.430
does is it puts spacing in between components of forms so that they look nicer and they just read a

03:27.430 --> 03:28.380
little better.

03:28.870 --> 03:39.390
So to show you what I mean by this I'm going to just delete these divs for the first two refresh and

03:39.390 --> 03:41.100
pay attention to the spacing here.

03:41.100 --> 03:46.780
For email address and password you can see here that they begin to get a little closer.

03:46.990 --> 03:52.540
And when we were dealing with our own input forms for some of the previous projects we saw that we were

03:52.540 --> 03:58.230
using tricks such as adding in a break or adding in an empty paragraph to get that margin spacing nice.

03:58.480 --> 04:02.830
But all that's taken care of for you and bootstrap student controls here.

04:02.890 --> 04:06.800
When you use the class form group and then let me refresh here.

04:06.950 --> 04:11.460
Now we can see the spacing is a little readable more readable now and especially between the actual

04:11.460 --> 04:16.050
blocks of the email address versus the password is just minor things that bootstrap is helping you out

04:16.050 --> 04:19.110
with a lot by having those classes ready for you.

04:21.170 --> 04:27.690
In the next class I want to point out is this form control class that's in the input tags.

04:28.150 --> 04:31.520
So we have these imput tags and we give them this class form control.

04:31.630 --> 04:34.870
Let's explore what they do by actually just taking them out.

04:34.870 --> 04:39.790
So there's my foreign control I've taken them out and I refresh over here and we can see that by taking

04:39.790 --> 04:45.760
out the form control on the Impe attacks basically we have what looks like almost normal ASTM L or normal

04:45.760 --> 04:47.420
CSSA styling I should say.

04:47.650 --> 04:52.160
Let's show one of them on this password and put just to see that difference.

04:52.180 --> 04:58.060
So with the form control tag I can see that it's rounding the corners it's making it stretch the container

04:58.060 --> 05:01.330
size it's actually highlighting a little differently.

05:01.420 --> 05:06.340
You can see that the highlighting has a bit of a almost like an alpha or a blur around the password

05:06.340 --> 05:06.920
box.

05:06.970 --> 05:10.960
Email is highlighting there but it's not as subtle.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.390
And those are really the two classes that are making the forms look nice for bootstrap.

05:14.440 --> 05:20.170
It's the form group and form control tags are classes excuse me they are going to be using all the tags

05:20.890 --> 05:27.970
the DIV tag for each form that's the label an input it should have the form group and then each input

05:27.970 --> 05:30.070
should have the form control.

05:30.070 --> 05:36.260
Now let's explore just a few examples of various different inputs to you're going to be using on a form.

05:36.340 --> 05:45.670
So I'm going to delete this entire form and then add in things from the notes so I'm copying and pasting

05:45.670 --> 05:47.590
from part to underscore forms.

05:47.620 --> 05:51.030
So let me copy and paste the email submission example.

05:51.400 --> 05:56.350
So here we have a label and put and we've actually already kind of explore this.

05:56.470 --> 05:59.260
But let's refresh.

05:59.510 --> 06:05.140
And this is a typical email address so we have the email address the email input's is where you would

06:05.150 --> 06:09.860
enter your e-mail and then you also notice that it says will never share e-mail to anyone else.

06:09.860 --> 06:14.960
This is really common to have a little explanatory text underneath any input.

06:14.960 --> 06:20.390
A lot of times in an email address to give some sort of a note like this what we use for that is this

06:20.480 --> 06:28.850
small tag and we give it the class form text text muted and it says whatever text you want to say behind

06:28.850 --> 06:33.100
that so that small tag basically just says OK a small piece of text.

06:33.110 --> 06:35.080
So it's not same size as a paragraph.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.730
That's another useful tip when you're dealing with forms.

06:37.730 --> 06:42.560
If you ever want to give a little note there for a particular aspect of the input form so that's the

06:42.620 --> 06:45.350
email submission going to delete that.

06:45.530 --> 06:52.340
And then I want to put in the password submission not too much to see here let's save it and refresh

06:52.850 --> 06:54.800
and here we can see a password submission again.

06:54.950 --> 07:00.830
We've already seen this with bootstrap going to copy and paste the next component that I have in the

07:00.830 --> 07:03.790
notes which is a dropdown select.

07:03.800 --> 07:11.450
So here we can see we have Supe's the select form and let's copy all this in then a little more just

07:11.490 --> 07:12.840
so it's more readable.

07:12.920 --> 07:18.040
Save it and refresh and here we can see what a dropdown form looks like with bootstrap.

07:18.040 --> 07:23.380
So if this trip you get this nice interface now we can see that it actually expands the entire width

07:23.470 --> 07:24.550
of the container.

07:24.550 --> 07:30.010
Again there are ways to control that with SS or just by adding the container itself but what a drop

07:30.010 --> 07:32.490
down menu looks like with bootstrap.

07:32.650 --> 07:36.080
If we want multiple select Options Let me show you what that looks like.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.470
There has also the class form control here.

07:41.340 --> 07:46.410
So I can copy and paste this save it refresh.

07:46.530 --> 07:50.630
Now we can see here we can have multiple selections.

07:50.760 --> 07:55.620
So if I want to select multiple copies I can do a shift and click and that's basically another example

07:55.650 --> 07:59.850
of something very similar to a dropdown except now I can select multiple options.

07:59.850 --> 08:06.010
And the way you do that is you say select just like we did last time but now you say multiple.

08:06.040 --> 08:12.310
So just to reiterate from the last drop down option which I'm going to copy and paste here for you to

08:12.310 --> 08:20.570
see the first one I save this and refresh it just a single selection if I want a dropdown that where

08:20.570 --> 08:27.610
I can select multiple things using shift or using control or command or you end up doing is in the select

08:27.610 --> 08:32.870
tag you add multiple And that's just a keyword.

08:32.870 --> 08:40.170
OK so moving along the couple more is that I want to show you are the text area with bootstrap.

08:40.170 --> 08:46.830
You can delete these and put it in text area it's also taking the form control.

08:46.830 --> 08:51.070
I refresh this and we can see a nice text area houses rounded corners.

08:51.220 --> 08:54.000
It has the ability for me to grab this and expand it.

08:54.290 --> 08:56.960
There's the file upload input.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.990
We actually saw that a little bit already.

08:59.140 --> 09:01.710
Well let's paste that in from the notes.

09:01.730 --> 09:07.820
We can see that it's also taking the class if we look here form control dash file.

09:08.060 --> 09:12.680
So that's another important thing to know when you're dealing with type file input.

09:12.770 --> 09:17.390
You want to make sure has the class form dash control dash file and the example here also comes at that

09:17.390 --> 09:21.710
small type that we've seen earlier which is some placeholder block level for help.

09:21.710 --> 09:26.120
So this would say something like oh please input your resume or something like that.

09:26.150 --> 09:29.270
Then you click on Choose file and automatically pops this thing up.

09:29.270 --> 09:29.950
Great.

09:30.350 --> 09:34.160
And like I mentioned before we don't know yet how to actually deal with something when we upload it.

09:34.160 --> 09:39.960
We still need to learn the actual backend technologies for that now there's two more I want to show

09:39.960 --> 09:44.470
you two more examples and that is radio and examples with bootstrap.

09:44.640 --> 09:48.410
So I'm going to copy this and we're going to see a couple new tags that we haven't seen yet.

09:48.780 --> 09:50.930
And those are the field set tags.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.580
So if we come up here we can see we have a field set tag and takes a class form group and the loss of

09:56.580 --> 09:57.240
a legend.

09:57.240 --> 10:00.080
So let's actually refreshes and see what that looks like.

10:00.090 --> 10:05.730
So here we can see radio buttons and that's the legend tag that's making it look like this.

10:05.730 --> 10:10.890
And you can see hopefully it's visible on your screen but I have an underline here because it's a Legin

10:11.460 --> 10:12.870
and so easy option is this and that.

10:12.870 --> 10:15.020
Be sure to include it's great option too.

10:15.060 --> 10:20.250
Option 3 is disabled so if you want something to be the table again that's Option three over here.

10:20.430 --> 10:24.760
You just put in a disabled call right here.

10:24.810 --> 10:26.010
Disabled.

10:26.250 --> 10:26.660
All right.

10:26.690 --> 10:29.340
So nothing too fancy going on here.

10:29.370 --> 10:31.730
You can just check that there's classes for each of these.

10:31.720 --> 10:38.310
So if you want it to be disabled you can say form check disabled as the class here instead of just form

10:38.310 --> 10:39.750
check.

10:39.750 --> 10:44.080
So here we have the class form check which is really commonly used for radio buttons.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.600
And as you may have guessed check buttons.

10:46.650 --> 10:50.160
So we're going to put in a check button example here.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.680
Copy and paste that from the notes

10:54.530 --> 10:59.690
paste it helps get rid of that field set and that division

11:02.980 --> 11:04.650
paste it in here.

11:04.650 --> 11:09.740
So here we have classes form check label is form check label.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.050
Let's refresh see what this looks like.

11:12.050 --> 11:14.100
And here it says check me out.

11:14.180 --> 11:15.610
You can click and click.

11:15.630 --> 11:17.000
Not much going on here.

11:17.430 --> 11:21.830
But if you want it you can put in class form check.

11:21.970 --> 11:25.270
And that's really all there is to forms of bootstrap.

11:25.330 --> 11:31.590
So let's copy this entire form from the notes and paste it in so we can see what's something or a bunch

11:31.590 --> 11:36.030
of options would look like I'm going to copy and paste this

11:39.470 --> 11:45.440
and copied everything including the form tags so I will save that refresh and here I can see a really

11:45.440 --> 11:47.650
large form example so I have my email.

11:47.690 --> 11:51.320
I can see the spacing is nice between the various inputs and the password.

11:51.470 --> 11:54.800
There's my example select Here's an example of multiple selects.

11:54.950 --> 11:56.710
Here's my example text area.

11:56.900 --> 11:59.600
Here's the Choose file and put radio buttons.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.360
Check me out.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.700
And then the submit button.

12:01.730 --> 12:03.250
Now we can always callers submit button.

12:03.370 --> 12:05.540
We have different classes.

12:05.650 --> 12:10.330
So before we end this lecture something I really want to stress here is that you do not have to memorize

12:10.630 --> 12:15.730
everything that I just went over and if it seemed like I was just quickly going over many examples but

12:16.210 --> 12:20.570
not diving deep into them that's exactly what we're doing for the section of the course.

12:20.680 --> 12:25.490
Bootstrap is just being able to see what's possible and being able to reference the documentation.

12:25.660 --> 12:31.000
So you have these notes available to you in your class notes if you ever want to make a form with any

12:31.000 --> 12:34.060
of these you can basically just copy and paste to your own needs.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.770
Or you can always just check out the documentation that has many examples.

12:37.810 --> 12:43.920
So here we see a basic example of a form that we can do things like a focus stay disabled stay etc..

12:43.930 --> 12:48.910
Validation States in line forms is a lot of examples in the documentation.

12:48.910 --> 12:52.340
It can be intimidating at first but really it's all here to help you.

12:52.540 --> 12:54.830
Just normal people referencing this and writing it.

12:54.850 --> 12:59.710
So don't ever be intimidated and if you have any questions posted to the Q&amp;A forums I'm always happy

12:59.710 --> 13:00.580
to help you out.

13:00.910 --> 13:01.360
OK.

13:01.510 --> 13:06.370
Hopefully you now have an idea of what's possible with the forms and bootstrap and that you're going

13:06.370 --> 13:12.490
to be using class formed that group a lot whenever you're actually dictating that you have a forum there.

13:12.490 --> 13:15.010
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

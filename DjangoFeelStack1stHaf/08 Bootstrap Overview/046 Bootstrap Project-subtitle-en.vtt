Hello everyone and welcome to the bootstrap project.

00:08.460 --> 00:13.140
But this project you'll be recreating a landing page and a sign in page that takes advantage of a lot

00:13.140 --> 00:16.590
of Bitstrips features that we've been covering throughout the section of the course.

00:16.770 --> 00:20.640
We should do is open the bootstrap underscore project underscore made that reached him.

00:20.650 --> 00:24.340
File in your browser and it's located under the bootstrap folder.

00:25.900 --> 00:30.400
Remember that you can either tackle this project on your own at first or just follow along with the

00:30.400 --> 00:32.620
solutions lecturer whichever you prefer.

00:32.620 --> 00:35.410
Let's take a quick look at the project page what it's about.

00:35.510 --> 00:38.010
And then you can decide how you want to approach it.

00:38.020 --> 00:39.590
I want to hop to my browser now.

00:39.920 --> 00:44.830
OK so here I have open in my browser the bootstrap underscore project underscore main that each Tim

00:44.830 --> 00:49.180
L file and this file actually contains all the instructions that you're going to need.

00:49.180 --> 00:54.880
So I would recommend copying the full path to this file and pasting it into your browser and leaving

00:54.880 --> 00:55.930
this as instructions.

00:55.930 --> 01:00.980
You can follow as you create a new HTML file to actually follow along with.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.500
All right so what are we actually doing here.

01:02.500 --> 01:07.090
We're creaminess coffee lover project for bootstrap and we're going to be doing is recreating this web

01:07.090 --> 01:09.100
page an additional form page.

01:09.280 --> 01:12.100
And there's actually all the instructions that you're doing here.

01:12.100 --> 01:16.380
So you're going to first create a general landing page for Jumbotron as I've done here.

01:16.510 --> 01:20.200
Then you can create a nav bar on the page that links to another himself file.

01:20.410 --> 01:26.710
So here we can see the welcome nav bar and if I click seinen it takes me to another h tim l file which

01:26.710 --> 01:28.370
is this project sign up page.

01:28.480 --> 01:34.510
So going back here to the landing page were you going to be doing is adding two paragraphs of Lorem

01:34.510 --> 01:38.730
Ipsum to the Jumbotron which we have over here.

01:38.740 --> 01:40.390
They're actually outside of the Jumbotron.

01:40.390 --> 01:42.270
You can add them inside the dome.

01:42.580 --> 01:47.020
And next you're going to use the grid system to add in thumbnail pictures of coffee and I've listed

01:47.020 --> 01:49.860
the source of the actual coffee pictures.

01:49.960 --> 01:54.670
And there's also image links here so image link one if you click on it it takes you directly to this

01:54.700 --> 01:55.360
image.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.960
That way you can either download them or just copy and paste this image file.

01:59.110 --> 02:00.130
It's up to you.

02:00.130 --> 02:05.230
But again you're going to use image tags and then copy in these six pictures of coffee.

02:05.230 --> 02:09.040
So here it can kind of think of this as some sort of coffee lovers blog where there's different pictures

02:09.040 --> 02:10.770
of coffee.

02:10.870 --> 02:15.520
But what's important here is that you're actually going to be discovering a new class of bootstrap on

02:15.520 --> 02:16.120
your own.

02:16.210 --> 02:20.840
So this is an actual practice of referencing the documentation for something you haven't done before.

02:20.860 --> 02:25.510
And in this case you're going to be looking up the thumbnail class for Bootstrap which is going to help

02:25.510 --> 02:29.440
you a lot actually organize these images and give them this nice little border.

02:29.880 --> 02:30.500
OK.

02:30.750 --> 02:34.750
Then after that you're going to make sure that the largest settings have three columns of pictures so

02:34.750 --> 02:38.030
here I can see I'm taking up three columns in total.

02:38.110 --> 02:42.010
That's four four and four if we think back to the grid system.

02:42.190 --> 02:47.140
And then the next row also has three total columns that means three pictures for four and four out of

02:47.140 --> 02:48.640
those 12 columns.

02:48.640 --> 02:53.380
And the other requirement is that on the smaller screen setting you should still have two columns and

02:53.380 --> 02:57.940
it's up to you where you want to make the change as far as where the actual breakpoint happens.

02:57.940 --> 03:01.140
But what I really am concerned about is if we minimize this.

03:01.150 --> 03:05.990
So if I shrink this down the smallest possible size scroll all the way down here.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.570
I still have two columns each.

03:08.620 --> 03:09.800
So it's going to be six and six.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.700
Six and six six and six.

03:11.710 --> 03:12.480
So keep that in mind.

03:12.490 --> 03:16.550
One of the requirements that on the largest setting it's three on a smaller setting.

03:16.550 --> 03:20.450
It's two and it's up to you where you want to actually make the break point.

03:20.530 --> 03:24.130
You can have it break at medium Breguet small etc. but an extra small.

03:24.130 --> 03:28.150
It should have those two in and the largest It should have these three.

03:28.150 --> 03:32.920
OK then you're going to create another h team l file for the sign up page and it's going to be a form

03:32.920 --> 03:34.870
with an e-mail password and a checkbox.

03:34.870 --> 03:36.160
We've actually seen it.

03:36.160 --> 03:40.750
But if you click right here on the sign and page we see a little Jumbotron here and has this e-mail

03:40.780 --> 03:44.930
the password and keep me locked in and submit.

03:44.940 --> 03:45.190
All right.

03:45.210 --> 03:46.130
So that's it.

03:46.140 --> 03:49.800
And I want you to feel free to really play around this project style add more to your liking.

03:49.860 --> 03:56.370
But the main focus of this project are adding in the nav bar adding in the Jumbotron adding in the form

03:56.370 --> 03:59.960
on a site and page the container and the grid system.

04:00.090 --> 04:02.070
So notice everything here is in a container.

04:02.130 --> 04:05.980
That way it's in the middle of a page in the grid system along with a thumbnail class.

04:05.980 --> 04:09.930
You're going to be discovering on your own here actually has the pictures of coffee looking nice and

04:09.930 --> 04:10.780
organized.

04:11.010 --> 04:11.550
OK.

04:11.790 --> 04:16.640
Again totally up to you if you want to attempt this instructions on your own before looking at the solutions

04:16.650 --> 04:22.440
lecture or if you like a more laid back tutorial style than just skip doing it on your own and follow

04:22.440 --> 04:23.780
along with solutions lecture.

04:23.910 --> 04:25.050
That's coming up next.

04:25.220 --> 04:25.540
OK.

04:25.610 --> 04:28.140
You have any questions feel free to post in that Q&amp;A forums.

04:28.140 --> 04:29.250
And I'm happy to help you out.

04:29.460 --> 04:30.100
Thanks everybody.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.190
And I'll see at the next lecture.

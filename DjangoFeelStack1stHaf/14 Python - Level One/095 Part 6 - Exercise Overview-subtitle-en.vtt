Hello everyone and welcome to part six exercise review.

00:09.310 --> 00:13.540
You've learned about the basic data types and data structures in Python and now it's time to put your

00:13.540 --> 00:15.180
new skills to the test.

00:15.190 --> 00:20.670
The part 6 underscore exercise underscore review that py file has commented tasks for you to complete.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.640
So let's go ahead and take a quick look at it.

00:22.660 --> 00:25.830
You can find this file under the python level one folder.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.250
It's just five simple problems.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.770
So let's take a quick look.

00:28.980 --> 00:29.220
OK.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.370
This is what the file looks like.

00:30.370 --> 00:30.940
Part 6.

00:30.970 --> 00:36.610
Exercise review and problem one just says this given the string S is equal to jingo.

00:36.850 --> 00:39.070
You want to use indexing to print out the following.

00:39.070 --> 00:40.550
The D O.

00:40.780 --> 00:41.060
D.

00:41.060 --> 00:43.260
Jan just Jan and then just go.

00:43.420 --> 00:50.110
So again you string indexing to print out the as 1 2 3 4 or 5 different portions of the string and then

00:50.110 --> 00:53.800
as a bonus question you can use indexing to reverse the string.

00:53.800 --> 00:59.230
You may want to review the notes because we didn't actually show that in the lecture video OK.

00:59.240 --> 01:05.070
Problem number two given this nested list right here this is l equals 3:7.

01:05.090 --> 01:06.930
Then there's a nested list inside of it.

01:06.950 --> 01:08.980
I want you to reassign hello to B.

01:08.990 --> 01:12.210
Goodbye problem 3.

01:12.220 --> 01:16.630
Using keys and indexing grab Hello from the following dictionaries.

01:16.630 --> 01:20.640
So here we have three simple dictionaries we can see as they go wrong.

01:20.650 --> 01:22.140
They get more and more nested.

01:22.150 --> 01:29.350
So what you need to do is grab Hello from D-1 dictionary one D2 dictionary to and then D-3.

01:29.350 --> 01:32.360
And remember there's also lists and D-3.

01:32.380 --> 01:36.260
So you have dictionaries inside of a list inside of a dictionary inside of a list etc..

01:36.280 --> 01:40.360
This one is quite tricky so take your time with D-3 see if you can work.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.940
Layer by layer problem.

01:42.940 --> 01:43.720
Float for.

01:43.720 --> 01:47.780
Says to use a set to find the unique values of the list below.

01:48.210 --> 01:53.400
Hopefully you're able to do that we kind of just did that in the last lecture so maybe review that.

01:53.400 --> 01:58.610
If you're stuck on problem for and then problem 5 It says you're given two variables.

01:58.620 --> 02:01.760
Age is equal to this integer for name as equal to Samie.

02:02.010 --> 02:04.780
I want you to use print formatting to print the following string.

02:04.980 --> 02:07.590
Hello my dog's name is Sammy and he is four years old.

02:07.650 --> 02:14.160
So again review the format method of what's known as string interpellation or putting these two as strings

02:14.260 --> 02:16.480
inside of this string.

02:16.780 --> 02:21.350
Ok thanks everyone and I will see at the next lecture where we're going to be going over the solutions.

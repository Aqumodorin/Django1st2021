Hello everyone and welcome back to Part 10.

00:06.900 --> 00:09.010
Simple game project.

00:09.090 --> 00:13.980
So we've learned enough python for actually create a simple command line game to finish off Python level

00:13.980 --> 00:14.800
1.

00:14.880 --> 00:19.830
Let's discuss the rules of the game and then show you an example run through of a finished game.

00:19.980 --> 00:25.650
The computer will think of a three digit number that has no repeating digits like three four six or

00:25.830 --> 00:26.900
seven to one.

00:26.940 --> 00:30.180
So again no repeating digits and it's just a three digit number.

00:30.480 --> 00:36.160
Then you're going to enter at the command line in input of your own guess of what three digit number

00:36.180 --> 00:37.910
the computer's thinking of.

00:38.040 --> 00:43.290
Then the computer will give you back some clues which will Taqwa a little bit based off these clues

00:43.470 --> 00:48.000
you're going to guess again and you'll keep doing it until you actually break the code with a full match

00:48.210 --> 00:53.970
three digits up your guess to the three digits that the computer originally guessed.

00:53.980 --> 00:57.800
So the possible clues are this based off your guess.

00:57.880 --> 01:03.250
The computer will say close if you've guessed the correct number but in the wrong position it will then

01:03.280 --> 01:05.530
also add a clue of match.

01:05.530 --> 01:09.230
If you've guessed the correct number in the correct position and then it will return.

01:09.250 --> 01:09.780
No.

01:09.880 --> 01:12.110
If you haven't guessed any of the numbers correctly.

01:12.310 --> 01:15.730
So we can get multiple clues back and that's possible.

01:15.730 --> 01:16.230
We'll show you.

01:16.230 --> 01:20.850
Now a quick run through of the game but you're going to need to look up a few things on your own to

01:20.860 --> 01:22.150
complete the project.

01:22.150 --> 01:25.040
There are hints for you left in this particular file.

01:25.090 --> 01:27.090
Part 10 simple games up PI.

01:27.100 --> 01:33.400
We haven't actually told you how to get input from a user but the hint is in part 10 simple game.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.270
Why do you get stuck on anything though.

01:35.290 --> 01:36.880
Feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.760
I'm always happy to help out or to check out these solutions.

01:39.860 --> 01:41.910
Pi or the solutions lecture.

01:42.010 --> 01:45.210
OK so let's see what this actually looks like.

01:45.220 --> 01:50.390
So here I've copied and pasted the solutions to the notes the PI file have opened.

01:50.440 --> 01:55.450
So when I say Python most up-I they'll say something like welcome Codebreaker Let's see if you can guess

01:55.450 --> 01:56.620
my three digit number.

01:56.620 --> 01:57.700
The code has been generated.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.690
Please get a three digit number.

01:59.710 --> 02:00.580
What is your guess.

02:00.580 --> 02:06.380
I'll get something simple like four five six enter it and it says there is a match somewhere.

02:06.410 --> 02:12.020
So I know either 4 is in the correct position 5 is in the correct position or 6 is in the correct position.

02:12.020 --> 02:15.360
So I can swap some of them out to double check this.

02:15.380 --> 02:18.580
So let's say four to three and I get a match.

02:18.580 --> 02:26.120
So I'm going to guess that four is the first number let's confirm that by saying for instance 4 7 8

02:26.580 --> 02:30.020
and now I get a match again meaning 4 is definitely the first number.

02:30.110 --> 02:34.370
And then you just keep guessing the number over and over again until you've actually broken the code

02:34.810 --> 02:35.430
again.

02:35.500 --> 02:41.210
The three possible clues are no close match and you can get multiple clues based off your numbers position.

02:41.210 --> 02:42.010
Thanks everyone.

02:42.050 --> 02:46.250
If you have any questions of this feel free to post the Kewney forums and I'll see at the next lecture

02:46.370 --> 02:48.530
relict through an example solution.

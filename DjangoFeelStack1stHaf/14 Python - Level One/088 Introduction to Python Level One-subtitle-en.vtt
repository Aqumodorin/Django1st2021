Hello everyone and welcome to Python level 1.

00:08.950 --> 00:13.870
We've already learned so much that it may seem crazy that we're only now reaching how to learn and how

00:13.870 --> 00:20.200
to code in Python because Django is completely based in Python for a majority of the course from now

00:20.200 --> 00:22.750
on we're just going to be working of Python.

00:22.780 --> 00:26.100
But your previous programming experience with learning javascript.

00:26.230 --> 00:27.310
Tim elsea Yes.

00:27.430 --> 00:33.050
And those fundamental coding ideas is going to help make learn Python a total breeze.

00:33.170 --> 00:37.400
So over level 1 and level 2 we're going to be covering a lot of the same general programming topics

00:37.400 --> 00:38.320
from javascript.

00:38.390 --> 00:40.890
Things like for loops and while loops etc..

00:41.090 --> 00:46.490
So we won't spend as much time in Python talking about the very basic idea of what a for loop is or

00:46.490 --> 00:48.830
what an array is or what those basic ideas are.

00:48.830 --> 00:53.270
Instead we'll just show you more the syntax of how to work with those ideas in Python.

00:53.420 --> 00:58.310
And then we're going to expand on these ideas to learn about object oriented programming something we

00:58.310 --> 00:59.430
haven't talked about yet.

01:00.970 --> 01:05.320
So if you've already taken a python course you may already know a lot but we're going to be covering.

01:05.380 --> 01:07.800
Especially if already taken one of my Python courses.

01:07.990 --> 01:12.390
You may find it easier to skip ahead to a section instead of starting from the very beginning.

01:13.290 --> 01:16.700
Let's outline some of the topics of both level 1 and level 2.

01:16.860 --> 01:18.440
To give you an idea of where to start.

01:18.450 --> 01:23.880
If you already have some experience in Python level one will start by talking about basic data types

01:23.880 --> 01:27.800
of Python that includes numbers strings lists and dictionaries.

01:27.850 --> 01:33.690
Then we'll talk about tuples sets and booleans control flow of python and how it uses indentation things

01:33.690 --> 01:35.720
such as the if else if statements.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.920
Then we'll talk about functions of Python then starting at Python level too.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.830
We'll talk about scope with Python.

01:41.840 --> 01:47.270
Will discuss object oriented programming of Python errors and exceptions decorator's and then regular

01:47.270 --> 01:53.370
expressions utilize the curriculum outline to jump to the lecture you feel is the most appropriate starting

01:53.370 --> 01:54.100
point for you.

01:54.270 --> 01:59.160
If you already have some program experience of Python or if you are a complete beginner feel free to

01:59.160 --> 02:01.250
just start from here and continue on.

02:01.260 --> 02:03.590
It has been a really long learning journey so far.

02:03.590 --> 02:04.770
Just to reach this point.

02:04.770 --> 02:07.740
So I really want you to take the time and congratulate yourself.

02:07.740 --> 02:10.230
Everything you've learned so far is challenging material.

02:10.350 --> 02:14.520
So remind yourself that you are awesome for making it this far into the course and give yourself a huge

02:14.520 --> 02:15.750
pat on the back.

02:16.550 --> 02:22.110
OK I level 1 and 2 are the only thing standing between you and the main course topic which is Django.

02:22.290 --> 02:26.550
So let's dive straight into it and get started by setting up Python and the Adam text editor in the

02:26.550 --> 02:27.540
next lecture.

02:27.540 --> 02:29.500
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
